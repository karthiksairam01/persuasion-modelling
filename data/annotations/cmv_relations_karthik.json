        "text": "Consider the definition of a prime number. It's a number that is divisible only by itself and 1. \n\nThis is the usual definition given, but by this definition it could be argued that 1 is itself a prime number. After all, it's divisible by itself. And it's also divisible by 1. The two things it needs to be divisible by just happen to be the same thing. So for this reason, there's an additional restriction: 1 is not a prime number.\n\nWhy is that? It's a completely arbitrary restriction. We just threw on a clause at the end that stated 1 isn't prime. It should be prime! So why isn't it?\n\nBecause it's not useful. \n\nPrimes are useful because with them we can do things like construct *unique* prime factorization for example. The prime factorization of 12 is 2, 2, 3 because `2 * 2 * 3 = 12`. But if we allowed 1 to be prime, then we no long have unique prime factorization. We'd also have 1, 2, 2, 3, as well as 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, and so on. This is just one example where limiting the definition of what a prime is can be useful. \n\nSo now back to the definition of 'natural'. Yes, the distinction between man made thing and natural things is arbitrary. But we make the distinction because it's useful for categorizing things. We didn't derive the definition from some set of core axioms. We arbitrarily added the clause \"Not made by humans\" so that we could distinguish between things made by people and things done without the influence of people. While we are, in a sense, not separate from nature, we are in a somewhat unique position relative to the rest of nature, so it makes sense to have language we can use to make that distinction.",

        "text": "I like to think of it as natural products can be found in nature in the form we use them regularly (without the need for a chemical transformation). If the only way the product is created is in a laboratory, factory or anything resulting from human activity than it could be called \"unnatural\", or synthetic/man-made if you want to avoid the negative connotation of unnatural. Even though all transformations from the raw material to the final product must follow natural laws, it does not mean that the transformations would ever occur naturally, without human intervention. Sure you can expand the definition of natural to include these man-made products, but if you were to do that, the word natural loses its ability to describe things and differentiate between things we find and use and things we have to chemically alter or create. If this were the case you would need to describe things as \"not synthetically made\" to gain an edge over man-made products that are marketed as natural.\n\nI'll try to give an example without getting overly scientific but trans fats aren't natural, by this definition. To my knowledge trans fats rarely occur naturally, if ever. This is because when fats are formed, they arrange the elememts in a different orientation, known as cis. One way that the kther form, trans fats are formed is at high heats when the chemical bonds in the fat are broken and the alternative arrangement of bonds is formed in the trans arrangement. If i remeber correctly, one way trans fats are made is when oil is reused after frying. Obviously, no natural laws were broken when the trans fats were made so I guess you could call them natural. However this type of fat is never seen in nature, so when humans digest it, supposedly bad things happen. I think this is because it is in a form that our bodies have never seen before. For this reason I would argue that it's fair to call trans fats unnatural. If you want to change the word so it doesn't interfere with the idea that we are a part of nature call them man-made products or synthetic or something. But I feel as though in order to keep everyone informed about the food they are eating, and products they are buying, there has to be a distinction.\n\nI don't feel like all synthetic products are bad, for example polyester and polymers have changed the world, and continue to do so. Especially the ones that combine different chemicals that are never combined naturally to get the most desirable charecteristics from each separate natural chemical. There are a ton of great man-made products like teflon and other coatings. They just don't occur naturally.\n\nOne more point is that the view that everything is natural is often used to market products, many of the \"natural flavors\" in food are created synthetically. Although I'm not completely sure if the chemicals they make are found in nature, many of them probably do. But this raises another question, does it matter how we obtain the chemicals, or just if they are observed in nature when we use the word natural?\n",

While your meaning is a valid (although pointless, because it doesn't make a distinction anymore then) one, another meaning that is often used for natural means \"compatible with nature\". For example, meat grown in vats would be natural because it can be broken down into nutrients and integrate in the natural cycle, but its plastic packaging still isn't natural. Another way to define it is by origin: a forest fire due to summer heat would be natural, a fire lit by humans not.",

        "reply_to_text": "I can't remember the topic that spurred this discussion, but a friend and I were debating whether man-made things were natural. He took the position that they are unnatural. \n\nHe cited this definition by Merriam-Webster:  existing in nature and not made or caused by people : coming from nature (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural) as his basis for the distinction for natural vs. unnatural.\n\nHowever, I respectfully disagree with his position and furthermore that definition of natural. People arise from nature. Humankind's capacity to create, problem-solve, analyze, rationalize, and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural? It is only through natural occurrences that we have this ability, why is it that we would give the credit of these things solely to man, as opposed to nature? We are not separate from nature, thus, how can any of our actions or creations be unnatural? If we were somehow separate from nature, I would understand the distinction between natural and man-made. However, I think unnatural and man-made are not synonyms by any means. It seems to me that man-made things MUST be natural due to our being part of nature. \n\nI would love to hear your arguments and to have my view changed if I am mistaken in my logic somewhere along the line.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for your responses lads. As many of you pointed out, our argument depends more on the context of the use of the word and I think that my friend and I were arguing about the semantics and definition more than our intended meaning behind use of the word \"natural\"."

        "text": "This is an anecdote, which is specifically not what you asked for. But it's not a pro-essential-oil testimony, so maybe you will find it interesting.\n\nI used to go for regular massages with a group of friends. Just basic back massages using oil, with some essential oils added for \"relaxation\". The first time we went, I felt extremely nauseous and dizzy afterwards and had to sit down for 20-30 minutes till it passed off. Eventually we worked out it was the essential oils - if I got a massage with just carrier oil (almond?) I was fine; if she added essential oils I was sick.\n\nI wouldn't expect something so negative to be a placebo effect (I had either neutral or mildly positive expectations for essential oils). And the effect seemed repeatable and strong. So, I wouldn't say I've found essential oils to be helpful for anything (except making me feel sick) but on the principle that if a drug has a real effect on the body then it should also be able to have side-effects - something natural medicine enthusiasts seem to often ignore - I suppose this has made me more open to the possibility that they have genuine physiological effects.\n\nProbably worth pointing out though that none of my friends had this reaction!\n\nFrom an actual scientific evidence point of view there are at least a few cases where there are real studies to support e.g. tea tree oil having antiseptic properties, but maybe these cases are exceptions.",

I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway). \n\nI think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying. Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse, and society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries.

People seem to think that we'll pull at the drop of a hat.  While there are undoubtedly a few a-holes among us that do, the *VAST* majority simply do not think that way.\n\nIn point of fact, *most* people who carry understand the weight of the tool at their disposal.  We understand that if we believe the situation warrants use of a gun then we've decided this is a life-or-death situation.  Thankfully, most average citizens, gun carriers or not, never encounter such situations.  Speaking for myself, I only have once in my life and it was more than 25 years now... and, I managed to survive it without a gun.  But when you do, the alternatives are facing it with a tool that we all know is effective at it's job, or going at it without that tool.  Even though I survived my one such case without a gun I wouldn't want to make the gamble a second time.\n\nNo, the truth is that most people who carry understand that carrying a gun makes you the pussy in the room.  It makes you the person that backs down from any and all confrontations long before they escalate to the point of needing a gun.  They understand that they are the ones that take the insults and just walk away.  We keep our anger in check at all times.\n\nWe're also the ones that are paying attention to our surroundings at all times, not burying our faces in our phones and whatnot, because we understand that situational awareness is the key to staying alive whether you have a gun or not.  We notice the little details.  We move to the other side of the street if we think we see trouble coming (whether it \"looks bad\" or not).  We're the ones that, more importantly, won't even *BE* on that street in the first place.\n\nLike I said, I'm sure you can find examples of people who carry who do so with the wrong mindset.  But if you spend any time around people who do carry you'll quickly realize those people are few and far between.  We're perfectly normal people, just like you, who just so happen to not want to be in a situation where we can't defend our lives.  Simple as that.",

Now imagine that a few people in the audience begin returning fire.  Do you think that all of them are going to correctly identify the original shooter in the confusion?  Do you think that all of the 20% of people with guns in the building will correctly guess that there is only one hostile target?  Now shots are coming from every direction, and the 80% of the crowd without guns have no idea which way they should be running to get to safety.  They are running in every direction, unpredictably entering the line of fire of the people with guns.  Now think about what happens when the police arrive and have no idea who they should consider a threat and who is a friendly, yet need to make that distinction immediately or risk being shot themselves.  \n\nI think in many cases a confusing crossfire resulting in even more deaths is the only realistic outcome we can expect.  There will also be scenarios where all or most of the people in the area being attacked know each other well enough to recognize friend from foe, but in general these kinds of things happen in public places where people are strangers to one another.  In those situations the panic and confusion of adding more gunfire will usually make things worse.  Add in the fact that people are more likely to be killed by their own gun in either a home accident or a suicide than they are of using it to defend themselves and I don't see any reason to believe the proposed scenario would lead to a decrease in deaths."

And the more people in the crowd all acting on their own, with no knowledge of which other shooters they should be shooting and and which ones they should be helping, the worse the situation is going to become.  \n\nI think that scenario is more likely, especially if we start encouraging a social norm that as many people as possible should be prepared to open fire at a moments notice.  So I'll play the odds and say that we should avoid a culture with that expectation.

There would be even stronger calls for an anti-islam and anti-immigration policies. These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government. I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway). \n\nI think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying. Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse, and society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries. I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the \"not one of us\" (pack) mentality and escalation of \"police state\".\nChange my view.\n\nPS: I am not here to talk about USA and its gun problems.\n\nEDIT: Awarded a delta to a comment which didn't refute this idea but led me to change my view that it would be best realized with paralyzing weapons rather then guns: http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rnr30/cmv_i_think_the_paris_shooting_makes_a_good_case/cni3o83\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Why should I need a gun to defend my life? You and I make the same assumption that dangerous people with guns exist around us, but we see a separate solution to that. One escalates it to more violence, the other does not.\n\nYou're implying that I am much more dangerous on the whole (for a reason you didn't even relate. Guns =/= self-defense). Please explain why.

That means that I don't belong to any of these 'camps' of thought.\n\nWhat do I really do? If I have entered a violent confrontation with someone, then I have already failed. I either avoid such things or solve them diplomatically.\n\nLet's say I have failed already. Well, then I suppose I would dissolve the situation to the best of my ability, ending it as fast as possible or with the least amount of harm to anyone. Would shooting someone be the fastest way? Yes, but it would likely also impart the most harm. Sure there are other ways of killing someone or maiming them without a gun but it is less likely then.\n\nYou must be wondering, then, what do I do if I am being threatened by someone with a gun? Since every situation is different, it's impossible to say. Getting into specifics doesn't really matter if it's with a gun or something else. One specific thing I guess I could say is that I feel like I would be in much higher danger if I had a gun.\n\nAvoiding danger and being safe is the only plan. Every situation is different.\n\nThis isn't such an easy issue, though. I can't just say \"don't get shot\" and be done with it. Unfortunately, the issue is festering and corrupt as it is. We train people to use guns to kill other people. It's one of the most philosophically ridiculous things to exist in our society. There are jobs out there that have the description of giving death to other things.\n\nBecause people can see guns as a way to kill other people, the fear will not fade. To not be afraid is to be blind to the issue.\n\nEventually people may not see guns as a way to kill other people (for whatever reason, please don't argue that this can't happen as that argument would be completely unrelated.) Then it won't matter if someone has a gun.\n\nNot in our lifetime!\n\nIn summary, it is best that the situation in which to defend myself never arises.",

However, the question I have to ask is how do you know the difference and what's your alternate strategy?  Are you of the \"I can always get the police to help\" camp, or the \"I can physically handle myself in any situation\" camp?  What do you do if someone attacks you, with or without a gun?"

This situation and a few others was the early starts of creating swat teams able to respond to armed gunman.\n\nFrance has gun laws allowing citizens to purchase hunting rifles with permits. In the event of something like that happening in the suburbs of France, citizens could respond. \n\nHowever, the situation is so unlikely to occur as shooters rarely take to a single place and shoot from in for such a long period of time. Most shootings happen in an instant and even armed citizens aren't aware of the situation as it is occurring. Police officers and hired guards are constantly in mental preparation of responding to such a situation and know they are expected to take deadly force when they see a lethal situation occurring. If I'm carry my gun all the time but I'm simply going to a super market to pick up groceries I will be reluctant to shoot till I've assessed what is occurring.\n\nAllowing concealed fire arms in a city like Paris to stop the threat of terrorists is a fruitless endeavor.",

        "text": "\"Causation\" is a very deep, complex topic, and when people who are \"explaining causation\" are accused of victim blaming, it's usually because they've taken an approach to causation which is unhelpful, oversimplified, or which misses the important points.\n\nIf we consider a hypothetical violent crime and ask, \"why did this happen?\" it's tempting to think we can boil this question down to one or two or three \"main\" causes. Let's say:\n\n1) Jamie was a habitual violent criminal  \n2) Jamie happened to be in Central Park looking for victims  \n3) Pat chose to walk through Central Park that night  \n4) Pat was unarmed, listening to headphones and not cultivating a lot of situational awareness  \n\nNow, which of these causes is the *real* reason for the assault? What would it even *mean* to say that one of these is a more real, or more important, cause than the others? It seems to me that, as \"cause and effect\" are popularly conceived, we want to be able to set up one-to-one relationships between effects and causes, as if history were some sort of sequential chain.\n\nIn reality, every single one of these conditions is a necessary condition for this assault to take place. If you removed any single one of these \"causes\", the encounter would have happened differently, or not at all. There isn't a \"chain\" of preceding causes for a given event, there's an infinitely branching family tree of causal ancestors.\n\nAnd in addition to these four causes, there are countless others which we didn't have time to list, such as:\n\n5) there were no police officers in visual range at the moment when Jamie and Pat crossed paths  \n6) Jamie didn't sprain an ankle going downstairs for breakfast that morning  \n7) Pat wasn't struck by a meteorite on the way to the park  \n8) A butterfly flapped its wings a few weeks ago\n\nSo none of this is news, and I think we're all pretty familiar with the idea that the future is a great big mess of intersecting and mutually-interfering causes, effects, and conditions, which can only be navigated probabilistically and heuristically. Our decisions about *which* causes and effects to focus on, in order to bring about the sorts of outcomes we want, must be motivated accordingly. The question which matters is not \"do victims ever *cause* their own victimization?\", because the answer to that is trivially yes. I can avoid car accidents by staying in bed all day every day, and in that sense, I am the \"cause\" of anything which *ever* happens to me, by virtue of the fact that I chose to get up and get dressed that day.\n\nThe more meaningful question to ask, is \"whose behaviour can be changed, and how, in order to optimize expected outcomes?\" I could easily avoid car accidents if nothing else mattered to me, but I have places to go and people to see so I make compromises, cross streets, and even jaywalk sometimes for my own convenience. None of this is reason to conclude that I don't know cars are dangerous.\n\nThe people who get accused of victim-blaming, IMHO, have usually failed to consider or address this second question in any meaningful or novel way - and the fact that they bother to express their thoughts on the topic *at all*, usually carries with it an implicit (and very condescending) assumption that the recipient of their 'helpful advice', the person actually *facing* the risk, hasn't already given the question any deep consideration of their own. Women are *well aware* that there are rapists out there. Black people are *painfully cognizant* of the fact that police departments have a racism problem. If anyone is acting, to your eye, as if they didn't know this was the case, the misunderstanding is almost certainly on your end.\n\nThere is nobody out there saying \"Oh wow! I never realized I could make myself safer by voluntarily refraining from some of the fun, risky behaviours which other people engage in!\" Most of the time they're aware of the risk, and they have been forced into a dilemma of choosing some compromise between freedom and safety *when they were supposed to have both*. When something bad happens, there will *always, always always* be someone around to say \"well you could have made yourself 5% less likely to be targeted by doing X\", and the only way to *not* receive this kind of useless advice from someone, would be to stay home all day every day. And if you die unscathed, poor and lonely after a lifetime of playing it safe, *even then*, there will be others who advise you to \"live a little!\" and observe that you could have created a better life for yourself by taking more risks.\n\nIt's not \"victim blaming\" to observe that victims have opportunities to reduce the risks they face, but it's condescending to imagine that you have better insights into how to do this than they do, or to assume that the reason they don't is that they just didn't know they could.",
        "reply_relation": "a",
        "reply_to_text": "I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification.

They want to understand why this thing happened, so that victims don't pile up. Usually when a crime is committed, it's assumed the aggressor is beyond good sense in the first place. Otherwise they wouldn't likely be committing crimes. But we *can* help potential victims by advising them not to put themselves at needless risk.

        "reply_to_text": "\"Causation\" is a very deep, complex topic, and when people who are \"explaining causation\" are accused of victim blaming, it's usually because they've taken an approach to causation which is unhelpful, oversimplified, or which misses the important points.\n\nIf we consider a hypothetical violent crime and ask, \"why did this happen?\" it's tempting to think we can boil this question down to one or two or three \"main\" causes. Let's say:\n\n1) Jamie was a habitual violent criminal  \n2) Jamie happened to be in Central Park looking for victims  \n3) Pat chose to walk through Central Park that night  \n4) Pat was unarmed, listening to headphones and not cultivating a lot of situational awareness  \n\nNow, which of these causes is the *real* reason for the assault? What would it even *mean* to say that one of these is a more real, or more important, cause than the others? It seems to me that, as \"cause and effect\" are popularly conceived, we want to be able to set up one-to-one relationships between effects and causes, as if history were some sort of sequential chain.\n\nIn reality, every single one of these conditions is a necessary condition for this assault to take place. If you removed any single one of these \"causes\", the encounter would have happened differently, or not at all. There isn't a \"chain\" of preceding causes for a given event, there's an infinitely branching family tree of causal ancestors.\n\nAnd in addition to these four causes, there are countless others which we didn't have time to list, such as:\n\n5) there were no police officers in visual range at the moment when Jamie and Pat crossed paths  \n6) Jamie didn't sprain an ankle going downstairs for breakfast that morning  \n7) Pat wasn't struck by a meteorite on the way to the park  \n8) A butterfly flapped its wings a few weeks ago\n\nSo none of this is news, and I think we're all pretty familiar with the idea that the future is a great big mess of intersecting and mutually-interfering causes, effects, and conditions, which can only be navigated probabilistically and heuristically. Our decisions about *which* causes and effects to focus on, in order to bring about the sorts of outcomes we want, must be motivated accordingly. The question which matters is not \"do victims ever *cause* their own victimization?\", because the answer to that is trivially yes. I can avoid car accidents by staying in bed all day every day, and in that sense, I am the \"cause\" of anything which *ever* happens to me, by virtue of the fact that I chose to get up and get dressed that day.\n\nThe more meaningful question to ask, is \"whose behaviour can be changed, and how, in order to optimize expected outcomes?\" I could easily avoid car accidents if nothing else mattered to me, but I have places to go and people to see so I make compromises, cross streets, and even jaywalk sometimes for my own convenience. None of this is reason to conclude that I don't know cars are dangerous.\n\nThe people who get accused of victim-blaming, IMHO, have usually failed to consider or address this second question in any meaningful or novel way - and the fact that they bother to express their thoughts on the topic *at all*, usually carries with it an implicit (and very condescending) assumption that the recipient of their 'helpful advice', the person actually *facing* the risk, hasn't already given the question any deep consideration of their own. Women are *well aware* that there are rapists out there. Black people are *painfully cognizant* of the fact that police departments have a racism problem. If anyone is acting, to your eye, as if they didn't know this was the case, the misunderstanding is almost certainly on your end.\n\nThere is nobody out there saying \"Oh wow! I never realized I could make myself safer by voluntarily refraining from some of the fun, risky behaviours which other people engage in!\" Most of the time they're aware of the risk, and they have been forced into a dilemma of choosing some compromise between freedom and safety *when they were supposed to have both*. When something bad happens, there will *always, always always* be someone around to say \"well you could have made yourself 5% less likely to be targeted by doing X\", and the only way to *not* receive this kind of useless advice from someone, would be to stay home all day every day. And if you die unscathed, poor and lonely after a lifetime of playing it safe, *even then*, there will be others who advise you to \"live a little!\" and observe that you could have created a better life for yourself by taking more risks.\n\nIt's not \"victim blaming\" to observe that victims have opportunities to reduce the risks they face, but it's condescending to imagine that you have better insights into how to do this than they do, or to assume that the reason they don't is that they just didn't know they could.",

The question of whether it's worthwhile to tell people stuff, depends on a couple of conditions:\n\n1) whether or not they already knew the facts you're conveying  \n2) whether or not the knowledge in question is of any value to them.\n\nI've already gone over why it's condescending to make unfounded presumptions about 1), but this \"autonomy\" stuff all contributes to how we should evaluate 2). When someone interrupts your dinner to tell you about a phone company promotional offer, the aforementioned 2 assumptions are both at play: the advertiser is expressing an implicit assumption that you *didn't know* you could get unlimited domestic calling for only $8.95 a month,  which is probably a fair assumption if the promotion is new and insufficiently publicized, but also they're expressing an implicit assumption that *knowing about this deal would change your decision in any way,* and furthermore that *this knowledge(and the opportunity to act on it) is worth more to you than an uninterrupted dinner*.\n\nThis 2) thing, is an assumption about your priorities, about how much you value your time and money, and about what other long-distance options you have at your disposal. I daresay it's this second assumption which makes us mad at telemarketers, even when we legitimately didn't know about the deal being offered.\n\n(How much worse would it be if the deal they were offering you, was just the exact same deal which you'd already been hearing about from every long-distance carrier for years?

That they are not deemed at fault for the collision doesn't change that.\n\nIn my admittedly limited experience, very few people are both skilled drivers and consistent practitioners of defensive driving. How many people consistently scan all of their mirrors, especially when stopped, or maintain both a safe speed and adequate following distance? Never look away from the road in front for more than 2-3 seconds at a time? Leave a gap when pulling up to an intersection to aid in escaping being rear-ended? Scan every intersection before entering? Attempt to maintain a staggered formation when driving on the highway? Never drive when fatigued, unwell, or otherwise unable to focus fully on the road?\n\n&gt;Most of the time they're aware of the risk, and they have been forced into a dilemma of choosing some compromise between freedom and safety when they were supposed to have both.\n\nI think one of the more crucial points of debate is whether or not their framing and evaluation of that decision is relevant or a valid target for criticism. I agree that many, even most cases are reflexive or ideologically motivated and can be fairly described as victim blaming, but the current trend is very much to tar *any* questioning of a victim's decisions with that brush. It may be good for the victim (I don't think it invariably is, but that's another debate) but it does a serious disservice to their agency.",

        "reply_to_text": "\"Causation\" is a very deep, complex topic, and when people who are \"explaining causation\" are accused of victim blaming, it's usually because they've taken an approach to causation which is unhelpful, oversimplified, or which misses the important points.\n\nIf we consider a hypothetical violent crime and ask, \"why did this happen?\" it's tempting to think we can boil this question down to one or two or three \"main\" causes. Let's say:\n\n1) Jamie was a habitual violent criminal  \n2) Jamie happened to be in Central Park looking for victims  \n3) Pat chose to walk through Central Park that night  \n4) Pat was unarmed, listening to headphones and not cultivating a lot of situational awareness  \n\nNow, which of these causes is the *real* reason for the assault? What would it even *mean* to say that one of these is a more real, or more important, cause than the others? It seems to me that, as \"cause and effect\" are popularly conceived, we want to be able to set up one-to-one relationships between effects and causes, as if history were some sort of sequential chain.\n\nIn reality, every single one of these conditions is a necessary condition for this assault to take place. If you removed any single one of these \"causes\", the encounter would have happened differently, or not at all. There isn't a \"chain\" of preceding causes for a given event, there's an infinitely branching family tree of causal ancestors.\n\nAnd in addition to these four causes, there are countless others which we didn't have time to list, such as:\n\n5) there were no police officers in visual range at the moment when Jamie and Pat crossed paths  \n6) Jamie didn't sprain an ankle going downstairs for breakfast that morning  \n7) Pat wasn't struck by a meteorite on the way to the park  \n8) A butterfly flapped its wings a few weeks ago\n\nSo none of this is news, and I think we're all pretty familiar with the idea that the future is a great big mess of intersecting and mutually-interfering causes, effects, and conditions, which can only be navigated probabilistically and heuristically.

Let's take your example: \n\n&gt;The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged.\n\nActually, it would have also prevented your being mugged had you left 10 minutes later. It further likely would have prevented your mugging had one of you been armed. If the mugger's spouse had a fight with them before they left the house to mug you, and this delayed them so you passed before they did, it would have prevented your mugging. \n\nYour being mugged is a *statistical* outcome, not attributable to any one behavior on your part. In this case, the root cause is exactly and only the mugger choosing to mug you. There's no other causal factor that would have actually *prevented* the situation, only changed the probabilities, and you can't really trust probabilities to guide specific behavior in specific situations. \n\nAbsolute \"causation\" isn't a helpful concept in cases like this. The causal factors of one individual trial of a statistical experiment aren't very important. The response to a statistical problem is not to change behavior on individual trials of the experiment, it's to address the root cause of the statistical problem. \n\nWe can't, nor should we, do everything in our power to reduce all possibility of danger. Surely you can see the reductio ad absurdum here. \n\nWe have to weigh the effectiveness of our strategies against the costs and benefits. If avoiding one part of town reduces your risk by (let's convert everything to dollars here for ease of calculation) $0.10, but it costs you $0.50 in inconvenience, exercise of your rights, enjoyment of life, and every other factor (most of which are very hard to calculate) then you \"should\" not avoid that part of town, even if it led to your being mugged.\n\nIt's not necessarily \"wrong\" to point out these statistical factors in order to help people make return-on-investment calculations, if that's your real goal. It's not too helpful, because people don't really have enough information, nor training in statistical theory, to apply that information. \n\nBut it's really very hard to come up with true valuations of these factors. Don't make the mistake of thinking that because it's \"obvious to you\" that a part of town is dangerous that it is worthwhile to tell someone they should avoid that part of town. \n\nIf you want to tell people in general that traveling in that part of town has a 0.01% chance of resulting in their being mugged and robbed of their pocket change (let's say the average is $100, with another $900 in lost peace of mind), by all means let them know that the expected cost of that behavior is $0.10, so that they can decide if it's worth that cost to them.\n\nAnd that's about accurate for the most dangerous parts of any town, and for actual losses typically incurred. If you exaggerate the danger, you're not doing anyone any favors, and are actually doing them harm, statistically.\n\nWhen you talk to an actual *victim* about these things, realize that they *already* probably have a vastly inflated opinion about the risks of their behavior, because they have suffered an unlikely outcome in that regard. \n\nAlmost in every case, if you're speaking to a *victim*, it would be more accurate to *downplay* the risks that they took, if your goal is to actually statistically help them. \n\nIf someone is in a plane crash and is injured, your telling them that riding planes is dangerous is true as far as it goes... it's just a lot less dangerous than driving, which is what they're likely to do instead. \n\nSocietally speaking, we have to be very careful what we warn people about, because everyone's mileage varies.

        "reply_relation": "a",
        "reply_to_text": "I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'm saying that even when you *are* engaging in causal victim blaming, when the recklessness was high enough, it can be justified.  That's not to say that you have to do that every time you talk about causation though.

I think you're just conveniently only paying attention to the times where it clearly isn't justified and ignoring the times where it is to draw this conclusion.  For example, how many times do drunk drivers damage their cars or themselves?  People will invariably say they are to blame for what they did, and the same goes for other similar actions.  You have no statistics as to how often that occurs vs how often people fallaciously blame rape victims, so you can make no claims about \"the vast majority\" either way.\n\n&gt; You really won't very often hear someone say it's \"victim blaming\" if you tell a person who fell while balancing on the wall of the Grand Canyon that he was an idiot. \n\nExactly.

It's blaming victims that aren't actually blameworthy that's inappropriate, which you are confusing with the broader statement.\n\n&gt; Among other things... they aren't really victims, because they weren't victimized. \n\nIf you think the word \"victim\" requires there to be some external perpetrator, all I can tell you is that you're mistaken.\n\n",

It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThis paragraph makes a couple of assumptions involving how our culture views \"cause\" and responsibility.  From a deterministic point of view, where you still have the freedom to choose where you go but everything else is predetermined, you entering a bad area is the \"cause\" of your mugging.  But that doesn't make you responsible for being mugged, because every individual is, legally, recognized as having the same freedom of choice that you have.  So the mugger chose to mug you.  That choice was the \"cause,\" not your decision to enter an unsafe area.\n\nYou increasing your chance of being mugged didn't actually cause your mugging.\n\nMaybe this is just pedantic, because ultimately there is a correlation between entering that area and getting mugged.  However, problems arise when people think they know how certain things correlate when they actually don't.  Humans are actually quite bad at probabilities and intuitively understanding them.  So it then becomes a problem when people think \"i'm not blaming the victim, I'm recognizing a correlation,\" because they don't usually have a good reason to believe that they are really recognizing a correlation.\n\nA great example of that problem is when the cause of a rape is correlated with what the victim was wearing.  First, culturally, the rapist is to blame, just like the mugger above, regardless of mitigating circumstances.  But second, there isn't actually a correlation between the chances a person will get raped and the clothes they are wearing.  People erroneously think that there is a correlation because it \"makes sense\" and they fall victim to confirmation bias.",
        "reply_relation": "a",
        "reply_to_text": "I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Just like the mugger. They aren't doing it to 'be a mugger'. The mugger most likely needs money. So he mugs people for it. Don't have anything on you, and the mugger won't/can't take anything. Results muted. The rapist (from what I understand) wants sexually related power. It's not so much the clothes. In this case, avoid drinks from strangers, be sure to stay mostly sober. And don't uncautiously enter unfamiliar bars.\n\nThe victim is the victim because of their choices.

        "reply_to_text": "&gt;The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThis paragraph makes a couple of assumptions involving how our culture views \"cause\" and responsibility.  From a deterministic point of view, where you still have the freedom to choose where you go but everything else is predetermined, you entering a bad area is the \"cause\" of your mugging.  But that doesn't make you responsible for being mugged, because every individual is, legally, recognized as having the same freedom of choice that you have.  So the mugger chose to mug you.  That choice was the \"cause,\" not your decision to enter an unsafe area.\n\nYou increasing your chance of being mugged didn't actually cause your mugging.\n\nMaybe this is just pedantic, because ultimately there is a correlation between entering that area and getting mugged.  However, problems arise when people think they know how certain things correlate when they actually don't.  Humans are actually quite bad at probabilities and intuitively understanding them.  So it then becomes a problem when people think \"i'm not blaming the victim, I'm recognizing a correlation,\" because they don't usually have a good reason to believe that they are really recognizing a correlation.\n\nA great example of that problem is when the cause of a rape is correlated with what the victim was wearing.  First, culturally, the rapist is to blame, just like the mugger above, regardless of mitigating circumstances.

X-street has a lot of muggings. Yes, you got mugged there, which adds another data point. Though had I not told you this info, you might assume the mugging wasn't connected to X-street and continue to travel along there.

Simply ignoring it because \"you blame the victim\" I think is more harmful to the situation.\n\nOn top of that, I'm not aware of what information you know. Like, did you know to avoid the streets by the lake in my community when night comes? You didn't, because you don't have knowledge of the area. It's also nice to inform you that coyotes travel around the outer edges. As you most likely didn't know that either.\n\nWhich is my point. It's not that I'm *blaming* you.

You avoid the 'bad' streets, and walk along the good ones. You can certainly walk along the bad streets and be fine. But there's simply a higher chance of, say, getting your backpack snagged while walking on certain streets. You can look at crime maps. It's pretty clear where most of the crimes occur, and where is safe.\n\nAlso knowing that there's a lot of car break ins might make you wary of owning a car (or keeping anything valuable in it). This information helps inform decision making.\n\n&gt;because the victim has no control over where the mugger/rapist is, so his or her choice to walk down a street is not really a meaningful factor.\n\nThis may be true if there's no significant data for individual streets/areas.

Generally this stuff is encapsulated by \"common sense\", but \"common sense\" is not something some people have. Other times it might be misguided (like slutty clothing causing rapes).\n\n&gt; Really, does anyone have a statistic on this? \n\nNot for \"being in dark alleys is bad\". But perhaps \"X street has a lot of gun shootings, avoid there\". Particularly look at San Francisco. Practically every other street has a clear level of criminal activity. You avoid the 'bad' streets, and walk along the good ones. You can certainly walk along the bad streets and be fine. But there's simply a higher chance of, say, getting your backpack snagged while walking on certain streets. You can look at crime maps. It's pretty clear where most of the crimes occur, and where is safe.\n\nAlso knowing that there's a lot of car break ins might make you wary of owning a car (or keeping anything valuable in it). This information helps inform decision making.\n\n&gt;because the victim has no control over where the mugger/rapist is, so his or her choice to walk down a street is not really a meaningful factor.\n\nThis may be true if there's no significant data for individual streets/areas. But it works on a general scale too. Living in a city with more crime means there's a higher chance of you being involved. If you live in a place with little to no crime, that chance reduces dramatically.\n\nIt's still a factor, and one that may or may not be able to be controlled, depending on the situation. ",

It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThis paragraph makes a couple of assumptions involving how our culture views \"cause\" and responsibility.  From a deterministic point of view, where you still have the freedom to choose where you go but everything else is predetermined, you entering a bad area is the \"cause\" of your mugging.  But that doesn't make you responsible for being mugged, because every individual is, legally, recognized as having the same freedom of choice that you have.  So the mugger chose to mug you.  That choice was the \"cause,\" not your decision to enter an unsafe area.\n\nYou increasing your chance of being mugged didn't actually cause your mugging.\n\nMaybe this is just pedantic, because ultimately there is a correlation between entering that area and getting mugged.  However, problems arise when people think they know how certain things correlate when they actually don't.  Humans are actually quite bad at probabilities and intuitively understanding them.  So it then becomes a problem when people think \"i'm not blaming the victim, I'm recognizing a correlation,\" because they don't usually have a good reason to believe that they are really recognizing a correlation.\n\nA great example of that problem is when the cause of a rape is correlated with what the victim was wearing.  First, culturally, the rapist is to blame, just like the mugger above, regardless of mitigating circumstances.  But second, there isn't actually a correlation between the chances a person will get raped and the clothes they are wearing.  People erroneously think that there is a correlation because it \"makes sense\" and they fall victim to confirmation bias.",

If you are discussing a specific victim, you're probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you're discussing the situation that happened, you're discussing causation. \n\n#3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It's perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It's not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house.\n\n#4.

        "reply_to_text": "I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

One could even extend the example further: if I knowingly go walking through a well-known shitty ghetto full of crackheads and murderers at 4 a.m. wearing a jacket made out of $100 bills and I get robbed, is that in no way my own responsibility? Of course the act of the crime is purely the fault of the criminal, but at the same time it is my individual responsibility to look out for my own safety, in the knowledge that shitty people often do shitty things.\n\nI agree that it's a very fine line to walk between the ideas of victim blaming and personal responsibility, and I'll be the first to admit that I don't know exactly where that line should be drawn, but I absolutely agree with OP in that this is a conversation that needs to be had in the general public.",

At no point did I suggest that I personally should be going around pointing out to every victim of crime exactly what they should have done differently. That's absurd. There's been a very interesting conversation in this thread about if and when it is appropriate to have that conversation with a victim of crime, but if that talk does need to be had, obviously it should be coming from someone with a complete understanding of the facts and the best interests of the victim at heart.\n\nBut even that wasn't my point. What I'm saying is that, IMO, we should analyze crimes that happen after the fact to determine what, if any, behaviours, situations, or choices tend to lead to victimization. We do this without assigning any fault to the victim for these choices. They don't even have to hear about the conclusions or be involved in the process if they don't want to (besides via the testimony they give, of course). We are simply trying to objectively determine which factors correspond to increased risk. We should gather data this way, and use it to educate people on risk factors so they are better able to make good risk assessments in the future.\n\n",

        "reply_to_text": "OK, but what purpose does informing someone of their fault after the fact serve? And are you the right person to be doing that informing?\n\nThere are people who are trained to provide that information in more useful ways, and those same people are given access to the full facts of the case. \n\nI see no reason that some random dude on the street should have any reason to feel confident about his ability to assign fault to any party involved in a crime. And I DO think it can be very harmful when someone, ignorant of the facts of the situation, attempts to assign fault anyway.\n\nTo get a little more specific, many rape victims face this kind of fault assignment, where people ignorant of the full situation rapidly come to conclusions from incomplete information and then for some reason feel that it is appropriate to announce these conclusions loudly and publicly.\n\nEssentially, I don't disagree that informing the victim of their unsafe behavior can be a good thing. I just think that in general, nobody but close friends, family, and investigators are really in a position to accurately assign fault in realistic situations, and therefore \"explaining causation\" is nearly never appropriate and is more likely to do harm than good when executed by a random stranger or acquaintance.",

That's stupid, she should have known she would get mugged.\"\n\nThe correct response is: \"Well, that's unfortunate. That's a really unsafe area. The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area.\"\n\nDo you see the difference? One is victim blaming. The other is having a mature discussion regarding the crime. It begins a helpful discussion on the realities of the situation and ways to improve the situation. It acknowledges your point - that there are dangers in the world that people can work to avoid - without dismissing the actual crime down to the victim's decisions. \n\nThe first just says it's all Mary's fault. \n\nIt's a massive difference. The first one should never be discussed outside of the victim, the police, and family. What if Mary was from out of town and didn't know the area was unsafe? What if Mary got lost? What if Mary got in a fight with her boyfriend and was kicked out of the car there? Are all of these not perfectly understandable reasons why Mary would be at that specific location at that time of night? How are you in any specific way able to judge the situation and draw those particular conclusions?\n\nDoes the second response not completely cover both your requirements? Explaining the causation of the crime and helping people through doing so (worthwhile)? Does it not do both of those *in a better way*?\n\nIt's *assumed* that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response. You hit the nail on the head here, you just miss the connection between the two. \n\nThe world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. By saying things like \"she shouldn't have been there\" we are exactly saying \"This would never happen to me because I would never do that\" and therefore make yourself feel better by justifying the issue and therefore the world.\n\nWhen we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don't talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don't talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThings got confusing here I think, so I want to clarify a couple things.\n\n#1. The point of all these examples was this: \"Causation\" can be discussed with or without victim blaming, and doing it with victim blaming does no one any good. These discussions typically do include victim blaming because it's human nature to victim blame, and discussing the topic without victim blaming is actually challenging. \n\n#2. How does this relate to OP's topic: Discussing causation is completely unrelated to victims at all. If you are discussing a specific victim, you're probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you're discussing the situation that happened, you're discussing causation. \n\n#3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It's perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It's not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house.\n\n#4. I wasn't trying to ignite a discussion on when we should or should not victim blame or where lines of personality responsibility are drawn and I don't feel like that thread is relevant to the topic. I was discussing only the conversation that occurs after there has been a crime.",

        "text": "&gt;If I burn my hand, does telling me fire is hot help me?\n\nYup. Fire is hot, hot things burn your hand. You burned your hand, which means you touched a hot thing. That helps. Which is why we tell children that. Intuitively, you know touching *that thing in particular* hurts. But not why. The explanation then helps get a general understanding. Then we can say \"X is hot\" and you know not to touch it. You *can*, but you get that same hurt feeling as before, so you don't.\n\nIf we had not told you, you'd go and touch some other hot thing, and burn your hand again, being sure to avoid *that particular thing*. See the problem? Knowledge helps a lot.\n\nGranted, I cant' be sure what you do/don't know. But I figure I should tell you either way to ensure you do know. Which is why I tell people things are hot, even after they burn themselves.\n\n&gt;If I stab myself with scissors, does telling me scissors are sharp help me? \n\nNo, but your actions which lead you to stab yourself might help you learn why you got stabbed. If you were running, perhaps you didn't intuit that running makes it easier to get stabbed. Or perhaps I tell you a safer way to hold scissors (upside down, but the sharp part in your hand, with the handle up). That way of holding scissors reduces the problems while moving them around. Maybe you knew that. But I don't know if you do. I could also mention they are sharp, but you are old, so you should know that by now. And I'm guessing you don't get stabbed by scissors often because you take this information into account.\n\n&gt;My response to all of these things would be \"No shit Sherlock\".\n\nA little kid might not know. Scissors are a simple example. Naturally people were told \"these are sharp, don't run with them, hold upside-down, etc\". Certainly little kids are told, both before and after. Why should other problems not be the same?\n\n&gt;My assumption here is that the victim we're discussing has at least an ounce of common sense. \n\nPerhaps they don't know that X street is dangerous and a common place  of muggings. They get mugged on X street. They might think it's simply the city, or perhaps they were targeted for some reason (wearing gang colors), or some other reason. Saying that it's X street, and lots of people get mugged there, is good information. It clues them in that it's a problem on X street, and not a problem with colors/clothing/city/time-of-day/etc.\n\nX street during the day might be fine. And maybe at night too. Sometimes the problem is simply X street at 3 o'clock. Since that's when the trouble makers get off from school. So avoid X street at 3pm, and you are good to go.\n\nThat's *very* handy to have. Although it doesn't help the problem in general, it allows the victim to prevent further problems *to themselves*. Naturally the global solution would be to focus on the perpetrators, and get them to no longer cause problems. But in the short term (and locally), giving the victim this information can help prevent future problems.\n\nSaying \"it's your fault dumbass\" doesn't help at all, and I'd agree. Sure, avoiding X street at 3pm might *seem* obvious, but perhaps you are new to town. Or maybe you just never visited X street before and don't know the advice to stay safe there.\n\n&gt;When something bad happens to a person, they know what happened.\n\nYes, they know \"what happened\" by they may not know all the causes. If you burn yourself \"touching something hot\" isn't the only cause. There's \"something hot is around\", \"someone or something made something hot\", \"there's a specific place where hot things are\", \"hot things appear at this time and for this reason\", and so on. You know to be careful around the stove, since there's hot things. But around the couch you are fine, since it's away from the danger of hot things.\n\nYou might not know that most hot things occur in the kitchen. Which would be good information. Naturally, this particular information is spread around as a kid, simply because of it's immediacy and how common it is.\n\nA mugging is less common. So naturally less people might be aware of all the causes.\n\n&gt;Telling me to look out when I trip over a branch does me no good.\n\nSure it does. \"Branches fall here all the time, so you have to watch your step\". Helps in the future, when you walk through this area again, or in the immediate future so you don't immediately trip over another branch. It might've been a one time deal with that branch in the way, sure. But knowing whether branches fall there a lot is good information.\n\nJust like how saying to \"watch your step\" on some stairs that have unequal stairs. You might fall, but not realize that's the reason you fell. So other people tell you to be careful on that staircase, because of the misaligned stairs. You might have attributed the cause to be simply your clumsiness, not realizing the stairs are actually at fault. Good information.\n\n&gt; Telling Bob tomorrow when you're walking down the street before he hits the branch does some good.\n\nRight. But if Bob tripped yesterday, and I told him yesterday after he tripped. Today he'll be equipped to know to look out without needing to tell him again.

        "text": "&gt;Not having sensitivity to the victim and their situation is a really bad thing though, regardless of fault or blame or the situation or crime or anything else involved.\n\nTrue, but that's a different issue entirely. It just so happens that these commonly go hand in hand. As people who are focused on the objective causes are also less likely to sugarcoat things. For better or worse.\n\n&gt;Imagine yourself in a situation where say your child was murdered. Would it be helpful in any way for you to hear an officer in the hall saying to a reporter \"Well, the doors were unlocked.\"\n\nMakes sense. Probably what lead up to it happening too.\n\n&gt;It's only going to make your healing situation worse, and now you're going to be blaming yourself even more than you probably already were.\n\nBut I don't blame myself. That's the difference. Yes, I had a part in the event happening (leaving the kid alone, leaving the door unlocked), but I wasn't the initiator of the crime. I understand this to be the objective situation, regardless of how I feel. Pointing out facts doesn't hurt, it helps.\n\nTake when my house was broken into. I was distraught and worried about my stuff. But I appreciated when told \"be sure not to step over near the break in point or touch the door that was busted in, as there's footprints that can be recovered\" I made sure to follow that advice.\n\nWhen they said \"you should get a security system to prevent future break-ins\" I followed that advice as well. It's not that \"I didn't have a security system so I blame myself\" nope. It's just one thing that helped lead up to the event. And it's good to know.\n\nMore specifically I learned the security system itself doesn't matter. It's just the warning sign out from that does. Which means you can simply stick a sign out there and get the same security, rather than buying the system.\n\nAnother aftermath was \"should've seen it coming, the people who broke in (neighbors) had parents that scrape vin numbers from cars and sell them.\" It's a logical thing I didn't consider. Hell, I just figured the neighbors were friendly like the rest of them and that my dad was just a racist fuck.\n\nIt *also* gave me the knowledge of hiding my valuables *in my house*, when I leave for long periods of time, so if there *is* a break in, that stuff isn't stolen. This is something I didn't know until I actually was a victim. It's not victim blaming (I don't take it to be), but if I hid my stuff, it wouldn't have been stolen.\n\nLots of advice to help prevent future problems. And I see it that way.\n\n&gt;Whereas, say a year later and let's pretend you had two kids, your neighbor walked over and said to you, 'Yaknow, I heard about this great new alarm system.'\n\nA year? I'd rather the helpful info be provided immediately, like what I learned with the break-in. Didn't wait no year to get a security system. it was installed ASAP.\n\n&gt;but we have to be sensitive to the victim's needs as well (who the f cares about a door, a child is dead and justice needs to happen).\n\nPerhaps. But telling a person \"I'm praying for you\" or the equivalent is functionally useless. It gives them 0 information, and doesn't tell them anything they don't know. Whereas giving advice does.\n\n&gt; That insensitivity is why it's argued to be victim blaming, and I don't disagree with that.\n\nI agree. This is the main reason OP posted this thread. He thinks the discussion *should* be focused on that information, rather than simply being pointed out as victim blaming and promptly ignored. I agree with OP. While we shouldn't make the victim feel guilty, we should provide information to help prevent future problems.\n\n&gt;Basically, the at the time of the crime, the victim is incapable of looking at the situation objectively. So keep 'em out of it entirely at that time.\n\nI have no problem looking at events objectively during the time. Hell, that's *all* I can think about. Typically though it's not about past preventative actions, but what's going to happen in the future. Well shit I lost my stuff, what now? Track the guys, find them, call the police, get an alarm system to prevent future break ins, etc. Not \"waah I lost my stuff and I feel bad, so I can't think about anything\".\n\nPerhaps other people are different, but I like to focus on the helpful things, rather than the pointless ones.\n\n&gt;You may not intend to victim blame if you were to say \"Well, everyone knows that area is dangerous.\" Because it implies stupidity on the part of the victim.\n\nRight, the tone implies blaming the victim.\n\n&gt;Allowing the victim some time before we start talking about all the things they did wrong intentionally or unintentionally isn't necessarily a bad idea. But that is simply because it's hard for a person to talk about a crime without talking about the victim.\n\nI'd disagree here. I'd rather tackle the problem immediately, so it doesn't happen again. Yes, it was awful. No, I don't want it happening again and want to prevent it as much as I can. It seems you (and others) have the thought: yes, it was awful. No, I don't want to talk about how to prevent it in the future. Yes, I'll talk about it later (if I remember).\n\n&gt;In the end though, at the base we agree.\n\nDefinitely.

That's stupid, she should have known she would get mugged.\"\n\nThe correct response is: \"Well, that's unfortunate. That's a really unsafe area. The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area.\"\n\nDo you see the difference? One is victim blaming. The other is having a mature discussion regarding the crime. It begins a helpful discussion on the realities of the situation and ways to improve the situation. It acknowledges your point - that there are dangers in the world that people can work to avoid - without dismissing the actual crime down to the victim's decisions. \n\nThe first just says it's all Mary's fault. \n\nIt's a massive difference. The first one should never be discussed outside of the victim, the police, and family. What if Mary was from out of town and didn't know the area was unsafe? What if Mary got lost? What if Mary got in a fight with her boyfriend and was kicked out of the car there? Are all of these not perfectly understandable reasons why Mary would be at that specific location at that time of night? How are you in any specific way able to judge the situation and draw those particular conclusions?\n\nDoes the second response not completely cover both your requirements? Explaining the causation of the crime and helping people through doing so (worthwhile)? Does it not do both of those *in a better way*?\n\nIt's *assumed* that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response. You hit the nail on the head here, you just miss the connection between the two. \n\nThe world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. By saying things like \"she shouldn't have been there\" we are exactly saying \"This would never happen to me because I would never do that\" and therefore make yourself feel better by justifying the issue and therefore the world.\n\nWhen we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don't talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don't talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThings got confusing here I think, so I want to clarify a couple things.\n\n#1. The point of all these examples was this: \"Causation\" can be discussed with or without victim blaming, and doing it with victim blaming does no one any good. These discussions typically do include victim blaming because it's human nature to victim blame, and discussing the topic without victim blaming is actually challenging. \n\n#2. How does this relate to OP's topic: Discussing causation is completely unrelated to victims at all. If you are discussing a specific victim, you're probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you're discussing the situation that happened, you're discussing causation. \n\n#3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It's perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It's not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house.\n\n#4. I wasn't trying to ignite a discussion on when we should or should not victim blame or where lines of personality responsibility are drawn and I don't feel like that thread is relevant to the topic. I was discussing only the conversation that occurs after there has been a crime.",

No but seriously, most crimes occur in private places, so the crimes occurring in dark alleyways are what's minimal. Your chance to be mugged is far, far lower than your chance not to be, no matter how dark the street. You are, in essence, accusing people of not forseeing something incredibly unlikely.

With the exception of children, poor people are poor because of bad decision making, poor money management, impulse acting, and other problems that go along with those.\n\n&gt;Not.\n\nNot? I'm pretty sure everything went fine. I miscounted the fact that the company was paying for the hotel, but I needed to charge it on my card. This was a risk-assessment failure on my part. But in the end, I managed to get things sorted out. If someone had told me this (or mentioned it after), I'd have known to prepare, and *know* to prepare for it next time. I know to be sure to check whether it's credit-card confirmed, whether the payment is going to me or if it's prepaid, etc.\n\n&gt;Everything went fine because you were lucky and the chance of being attacked is incredibly low, even in dangerous places.\n\nBut isn't (according to you) the reason people get attacked is because of dangerous people? You are contradicting yourself. I actually almost got scammed. But I used my brain, minimized risk, and turned down suspicious offers. Minimizing risk is the whole point.\n\n&gt;Do you think every single person who is attacked is just an idiot who isn't being cautious?\n\nMore or less. Either they didn't calculate the risks, or they lacked something in that calculation. Or perhaps they simply made a poor decision knowing the risk. Either way, they are either an idiot, or one who knew the risks and accepted them. Which is why informing them afterward is useful.\n\n&gt;Most people who are assaulted, raped, or murdered are victims of people they already know.\n\nYup, which reveals even *more* bad decision making. Why associate with people who would do that? Why keep yourself vulnerable to people who you don't know if they would do that or not? Sure, when you are younger, it makes sense to make these mistakes. I had a 'friend', who was great. But he ended up stealing from me. Looking back, it's obvious. He's a lier (which I knew, but was fine with), he came from a poor family, didn't clean up well, generally had a bad reputation,  etc. I should've known, but I didn't. Because I was a kid and wasn't told of this type of thing. I immediately broke off contact and was wary of similar individuals in the future.\n\nIn comparison, I had another poor friend, same type of situation, but he didn't steal at all, though I was careful about keeping an eye on him. He turned out to not be that great of a friend, but he was okay. I kept him at a distance.\n\nPeople have too much trust, and not enough risk awareness.\n\n&gt;In many cases, people they have a reason to trust, like friends and close family.\n\nFamily can't be trusted. At least, mine can't. They've proven that to me time and time again. Friends I take on a case-by-case. Some friends I'd trust with my life. Others I wouldn't trust with the TV. Trusting people blindly is stupid. The friends I'd trust with my life have the same attitude towards me, and I've known them my entire life. I know how they think, I know how they behave, etc. I realize there's a risk of them backstabbing me, but that's incredibly low. Other friends I have a very low tolerance for, as I mentioned.\n\n&gt; But they aren't smart like you, so it's their fault. \n\nIt's not about being smart. It's about risk-management.\n\n&gt;Similarly, if you'd been attacked, you'd be crying that it was unfair and not your fault, but you're quick to assume everyone else is a complete dumbfuck who doesn't know how to tie his shoes, much less protect his safety.\n\nNope, I've had a history of being stolen from when I was younger. When I was pretty much powerless (can't move due to parents) and stupid (being a little kid). Both are definitely fair. I simply assumed nothing could go wrong. And that was stupid. But I was a dumb kid who listened to everything the \"feel good people\" told me. Once I got my hands on the internet, the truth became clear, and I brought up my guard. Never had a problem after that.\n\n&gt;Sorry bud, you can't answer a \"should we\" question with yes and no. We either do it or we don't.\n\nAs I said, my moral response is yes and no. It's not entirely her fault. But her living there definitely is part of the cause. The straight objective answer is \"yes\", but that doesn't reflect my thoughts on the matter entirely. It's a simplification used to straw man my views. In a morally grey world, nothing is black and white. Is it okay to kill a fat man in order to save 10 thin people? Yes and no is the answer. It just depends.\n\n&gt; If you aren't sure about your morals in this situation, don't try to debate about it.\n\nMy views are very clear. But \"should we all\" is not part of them. I don't think everyone should do the same thing. I also don't think telling Mary is an obligation. I also don't think Mary is the entire reason it happened. So it's a straw man. I *must* say yes and no, it encapsulates some of my view, and other parts don't.\n\nYes, Mary was part of the cause. Yes, Mary could've prevented it by acting differently. Yes, it's a good idea to tell Mary what she could do to prevent future acts. No, it's not entirely Mary who caused the event. \n\n&gt;Did your mother walk you home from the bus stop when you were 15? That would actually explain a lot.\n\nYes and no. Again, not a straight answer, because it can't be. Some days I caught a ride with my parents, other days I took the bus. I went to a small school my entire life. I knew the people who went on the bus. Actually though, at 15 I was in high school, so yes, since it's a far distance I got a ride with my Dad in the morning when he went to work.\n\nBut in general, what the fuck are you doing in an area that isn't safe alone when you are under 18? That's ignoring the risks, which is entirely what my point is. Both the parents being ignorant *and* the child. I *chose* to stay home when I was that age. Simply because I found it a better use of my time.\n\nI also used that time to skip ahead a few years, take college classes, as well as work as a college tutor. Again, focusing on risk management and planning goals.\n\nWhat would be stupid is to go hang out in bums park at that time. Again, why the fuck would I be there? Why would my parents *let me* go there? My parents have a low risk tolerance anyway, and are pretty cautious. I don't mind it, and actually have adopted a similar mindset because of it.\n\n&gt; No but seriously, most crimes occur in private places, so the crimes occurring in dark alleyways are what's minimal.\n\nDefinitely true.\n\n&gt;Your chance to be mugged is far, far lower than your chance not to be, no matter how dark the street.\n\nI'd argue that your chance to be mugged is dependent on how much time you spend around muggers. I'd imagine muggers mug each other a lot. When you hang around criminals, you'll be involved in crimes. Makes sense.\n\n&gt;You are, in essence, accusing people of not forseeing something incredibly unlikely. \n\nWalking down dark alleys is a bad idea anyway, muggers or not. Can't see where you are going, could be wild animals (which happens, I've seen coyotes, raccoons, etc), can get lost, might have picketpockets or muggers, etc. Though it really depends on the area too. \n\nI'm not accusing people of anything. I'm saying to look at the risks, and figure out what's safest, if that matters to you.\n\n&gt; I might as well ask why you visit your family on the holidays, since there's a statistic chance they'll rape and murder you.\n\nI typically don't. I also acknowledge that there's a good chance of domestic violence, rampant alcoholism and drinking, etc. I acknowledge these facts when I visit, and I visit typically because I enjoy (most of them anyway) their sober opinions on things. I don't typically like my Dad, but when he's sober he's pretty responsible, which I like. When he's drunk, I avoid him. My mom is chill mostly. Sober she's fun and has cool thoughts. Drunk she just complains a lot, nothing that bad. My siblings are fine. Most of them share a similar mindset than me, and if need be I can defend myself from them (haha).\n\nOther family I don't visit at all. And if my immediate family visits them (and I tag along) I treat them as strangers, not family.\n\nSo yes, I'm well aware of the risks and if something were to happen, I acknowledge I made a bad move and it's partly my fault I got into it.\n\n&gt;Not all risks can be avoided. \n\nRight, but they can be minimized. Though most of the time, the victim didn't minimize anything.\n\n&gt;What if there's no alternative but to go down the dark street to get home?\n\nThis implies you passed the street originally. When leaving the house, be sure to follow lit streets. Easy.\n\n&gt;Where I live, there are miles and miles of land with no streelights, and neighborhoods with several blocks that have no light at all. \n\nMove to an area that does. Easy.\n\n&gt;Not everyone is so fortunate as to be able to get rides everywhere, particularly poor people who can't afford the gas.\n\nI actually walk. I live in a well lit area, and one that is generally considered the safest city in the US. I chose it intentionally. The entire place is actually owned by one huge company, which the city is named after. So pretty much everything around is land owned by them, and there's security all over the place and well trusted workers. No problems.\n\n&gt;What if the mugger chooses Mary because a previous mark looked too intimidating?\n\nMy argument is on opportunistic crimes, not premeditated ones. Which is an entirely different story. If someone sees Mary in their yearbook, remembers her and wants to kill her. There's nothing Mary can do to minimize the risk. She *is* the target. The only thing to do would then be avoid her killer. Which she couldn't know about. In this case, you'd have a point.\n\nMy point (like OP) is to discuss rational and logical ways of minimizing risks that the victim could've done.\n\n&gt;if the mugger had no expenses, he wouldn't be out mugging people.\n\nTrue, and this is what we should focus on, why the mugger committed the crime.",

What if the mugger chooses Mary because a previous mark looked too intimidating? Is he also at fault? Let's blame the mugger's landlord for asking for rent money too, after all, if the mugger had no expenses, he wouldn't be out mugging people.

With the exception of children, poor people are poor because of bad decision making, poor money management, impulse acting, and other problems that go along with those.\n\n&gt;Not.\n\nNot? I'm pretty sure everything went fine. I miscounted the fact that the company was paying for the hotel, but I needed to charge it on my card. This was a risk-assessment failure on my part. But in the end, I managed to get things sorted out. If someone had told me this (or mentioned it after), I'd have known to prepare, and *know* to prepare for it next time. I know to be sure to check whether it's credit-card confirmed, whether the payment is going to me or if it's prepaid, etc.\n\n&gt;Everything went fine because you were lucky and the chance of being attacked is incredibly low, even in dangerous places.\n\nBut isn't (according to you) the reason people get attacked is because of dangerous people? You are contradicting yourself. I actually almost got scammed. But I used my brain, minimized risk, and turned down suspicious offers. Minimizing risk is the whole point.\n\n&gt;Do you think every single person who is attacked is just an idiot who isn't being cautious?\n\nMore or less. Either they didn't calculate the risks, or they lacked something in that calculation. Or perhaps they simply made a poor decision knowing the risk. Either way, they are either an idiot, or one who knew the risks and accepted them. Which is why informing them afterward is useful.\n\n&gt;Most people who are assaulted, raped, or murdered are victims of people they already know.\n\nYup, which reveals even *more* bad decision making. Why associate with people who would do that? Why keep yourself vulnerable to people who you don't know if they would do that or not? Sure, when you are younger, it makes sense to make these mistakes. I had a 'friend', who was great. But he ended up stealing from me. Looking back, it's obvious. He's a lier (which I knew, but was fine with), he came from a poor family, didn't clean up well, generally had a bad reputation,  etc. I should've known, but I didn't. Because I was a kid and wasn't told of this type of thing. I immediately broke off contact and was wary of similar individuals in the future.\n\nIn comparison, I had another poor friend, same type of situation, but he didn't steal at all, though I was careful about keeping an eye on him. He turned out to not be that great of a friend, but he was okay. I kept him at a distance.\n\nPeople have too much trust, and not enough risk awareness.\n\n&gt;In many cases, people they have a reason to trust, like friends and close family.\n\nFamily can't be trusted. At least, mine can't. They've proven that to me time and time again. Friends I take on a case-by-case. Some friends I'd trust with my life. Others I wouldn't trust with the TV. Trusting people blindly is stupid. The friends I'd trust with my life have the same attitude towards me, and I've known them my entire life. I know how they think, I know how they behave, etc. I realize there's a risk of them backstabbing me, but that's incredibly low. Other friends I have a very low tolerance for, as I mentioned.\n\n&gt; But they aren't smart like you, so it's their fault. \n\nIt's not about being smart. It's about risk-management.\n\n&gt;Similarly, if you'd been attacked, you'd be crying that it was unfair and not your fault, but you're quick to assume everyone else is a complete dumbfuck who doesn't know how to tie his shoes, much less protect his safety.\n\nNope, I've had a history of being stolen from when I was younger. When I was pretty much powerless (can't move due to parents) and stupid (being a little kid). Both are definitely fair. I simply assumed nothing could go wrong. And that was stupid. But I was a dumb kid who listened to everything the \"feel good people\" told me. Once I got my hands on the internet, the truth became clear, and I brought up my guard. Never had a problem after that.\n\n&gt;Sorry bud, you can't answer a \"should we\" question with yes and no. We either do it or we don't.\n\nAs I said, my moral response is yes and no. It's not entirely her fault. But her living there definitely is part of the cause. The straight objective answer is \"yes\", but that doesn't reflect my thoughts on the matter entirely. It's a simplification used to straw man my views. In a morally grey world, nothing is black and white. Is it okay to kill a fat man in order to save 10 thin people? Yes and no is the answer. It just depends.\n\n&gt; If you aren't sure about your morals in this situation, don't try to debate about it.\n\nMy views are very clear. But \"should we all\" is not part of them. I don't think everyone should do the same thing. I also don't think telling Mary is an obligation. I also don't think Mary is the entire reason it happened. So it's a straw man. I *must* say yes and no, it encapsulates some of my view, and other parts don't.\n\nYes, Mary was part of the cause. Yes, Mary could've prevented it by acting differently.

The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area.\"\n\nDo you see the difference? One is victim blaming. The other is having a mature discussion regarding the crime. It begins a helpful discussion on the realities of the situation and ways to improve the situation. It acknowledges your point - that there are dangers in the world that people can work to avoid - without dismissing the actual crime down to the victim's decisions. \n\nThe first just says it's all Mary's fault. \n\nIt's a massive difference. The first one should never be discussed outside of the victim, the police, and family. What if Mary was from out of town and didn't know the area was unsafe? What if Mary got lost? What if Mary got in a fight with her boyfriend and was kicked out of the car there? Are all of these not perfectly understandable reasons why Mary would be at that specific location at that time of night? How are you in any specific way able to judge the situation and draw those particular conclusions?\n\nDoes the second response not completely cover both your requirements? Explaining the causation of the crime and helping people through doing so (worthwhile)? Does it not do both of those *in a better way*?\n\nIt's *assumed* that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response. You hit the nail on the head here, you just miss the connection between the two. \n\nThe world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. By saying things like \"she shouldn't have been there\" we are exactly saying \"This would never happen to me because I would never do that\" and therefore make yourself feel better by justifying the issue and therefore the world.\n\nWhen we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don't talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don't talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThings got confusing here I think, so I want to clarify a couple things.\n\n#1. The point of all these examples was this: \"Causation\" can be discussed with or without victim blaming, and doing it with victim blaming does no one any good. These discussions typically do include victim blaming because it's human nature to victim blame, and discussing the topic without victim blaming is actually challenging. \n\n#2. How does this relate to OP's topic: Discussing causation is completely unrelated to victims at all. If you are discussing a specific victim, you're probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you're discussing the situation that happened, you're discussing causation. \n\n#3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It's perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It's not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house.\n\n#4. I wasn't trying to ignite a discussion on when we should or should not victim blame or where lines of personality responsibility are drawn and I don't feel like that thread is relevant to the topic. I was discussing only the conversation that occurs after there has been a crime.",

The point of all these examples was this: \"Causation\" can be discussed with or without victim blaming, and doing it with victim blaming does no one any good. These discussions typically do include victim blaming because it's human nature to victim blame, and discussing the topic without victim blaming is actually challenging. \n\n#2. How does this relate to OP's topic: Discussing causation is completely unrelated to victims at all. If you are discussing a specific victim, you're probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you're discussing the situation that happened, you're discussing causation. \n\n#3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It's perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It's not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house.\n\n#4. I wasn't trying to ignite a discussion on when we should or should not victim blame or where lines of personality responsibility are drawn and I don't feel like that thread is relevant to the topic. I was discussing only the conversation that occurs after there has been a crime.",

It was the sketchy neighbors who scraped the vin numbers off cars and sold them. Obviously they were no good. All my life I told my parents how shitty of a place we live is, they didn't care, bunkered down with an expensive house anyway. And voila, we got broken into.

        "text": "&gt;Exactly how do you define \"fault\"? Cause I'm pretty sure we don't agree on this word.\n\nDeliberately creating an action that leads to an event. You bought a plane ticket, the plane then crashed. It is your fault you died in a plane crash. It is *not* your fault that the plane itself crashed. Just that you were on it.\n\n&gt;I am not trying to suggest that people have no responsibility for their own personal safety. \n\nThis is commonly the reason people point out 'victim-blamers'. The point is that people have responsibility for their safety. And they are always at fault for their location and situation. Avoiding bad situations and going to good ones is entirely the responsibility of the person.\n\nIs it their fault the crime occurred? No. But it's their fault they were the victim (provided that the crime would have occurred had another person been in that situation).\n\n&gt; But the reverse applies as well, shouldn't it? Sure, it's hard to get rid of that mugger. But we can do a lot to improve the situations around us.\n\nNaturally. Though you might not be able to 'blame' the mugger. Perhaps it's a mental illness. We shouldn't punish that. We should get it fixed. If someone jumps off a building because they are depressed, is that their fault? Partly. They have a mental illness, and they didn't keep check on their mental health. No mental illness, and they wouldn't have done that. But they still chose to jump off the building.\n\nSo instead of throwing the person in jail or punishing them (or 'victim-blaming'), we should treat the problem itself, and reduce the chances of it happening. One way is to remove all the buildings. But that doesn't solve the problem, it just removes that particular instance. The root of the problem is the illness. Not the person or situation.\n\nWith the mugger, same thing. What's the reason they mugged? Try to fix that, rather than simply punish.\n\nOn the flip side, the victim should also be aware of how to avoid those situations. Regardless of whether or not they are the one who initiated the action (they might have been). Say they were taunting a drunk guy. It's their fault they got punched. Don't taunt drunk people and you won't get punched. Simple.

But that's why a discussion is necessary, rather than to drown it out with \"VICTIM BLAMING LA LA LA CANT HEAR YOU!\" While technically suicide would prevent further crimes being done to you, it's not an optimal solution. Just like being in your house 24/7 would work, but is also not optimal. At some point there's a bit of risk, and each person has a tolerance for that risk.\n\n&gt;As my original post says, it completely depends on how the topic is approached. Yes, you can share information to an uneducated person to prevent bad situations from occurring.\n\nThis is the point being addressed. Whenever you attempt to share advice to the victim, it gets construed as victim blaming. Which isn't the intent most of the time.\n\n&gt;Well, you made it a part of the argument. The topic is victim blaming, and that includes arguing about the definition of victim blaming because not everyone agrees to the extent of it.\n\nFor this arguement/discussion, yes. But I meant more of in the terms of what we should do to fix an individual problem. We shouldn't say \"it's this random criminal's fault!\" just like we shouldn't say \"it's this random victim's fault!\" we should say: here's x/y/z of what happened and what lead up to it. Some actions were done by both parties. Here's a way to fix it to prevent future things from happening.\n\nBy pointing fault and blame, it's being counterproductive. Both are at fault, technically.\n\n&gt;I don't agree this definition you use is relevant at all, and its not the normal definition that the average person uses, so you just make this all confusing. The mere existence of a person in a place does not place them \"at fault\" for anything. All you are saying is \"things happen because things\".\n\nThis is true though. How do you define fault in a useful way? IMO you can't. The most accurate would be to describe the causes that lead up to it. The least accurate and useful would be to say it's the criminal, which we already have a word for. What use do you have by using the word when discussing an event? Note that the people who call out 'victim blaming' are the ones using fault. Not the people giving advice.\n\n&gt;So maybe we should use the word \"culpable\" instead of \"fault\" here to clarify exactly what we mean. Culpable simply means \"to blame\".\n\nWhy do we need to blame anything? Why not simply state the causes and actions that lead up the the event and how to avoid them? Blaming things is useless.\n\n&gt;Is the victim culpable for being mugged? No. To suggest otherwise would be victim blaming. Yes: Regardless of personal responsibility, because that's a completely separate issue.\n\nI would say they are, in part, responsible for the event to occur. If they weren't present, the event wouldn't occur. Whether their intention was to cause it or not doesn't matter (it does when apprehending criminals though). It's like if you pulled the table cloth and a glass fell. You caused the glass to fall. You may not have intended it, but that's what happened when you did your actions. Don't pull the table cloth, and the glass won't fall (whoops, victim blaming, I forgot).\n\n&gt;And that's my entire point in my original response. Victim blaming and the discussions had afterward are in no way related to each other when the discussion is had correctly UNLESS you can prove culpability, like your example of a person getting punched when provoking a drunk guy. You can prove the guy was provoked, because there would be witnesses.\n\nBut what if provoking him was unintended? Simply someone speaking their mind, unintentionally provoking the other person, who then initiated the conflict? This can be stretched further to thieves. Is flashing around expensive gadgets provoking a thief? Either way, both are causes in the same way: helping build motive for a crime/problem.\n\nThe point isn't to point fault at the victim. It's to help the victim realize what they can do to prevent future similar problems. Whether it be the direct cause or not. Driving accidents are solely caused by driving, regardless who's at fault. So if you don't drive, you won't get into one. Simple. It's \"victim blaming\" according to you, but also valuable advice.\n\n&gt;That is where the line gets blurry, on \"unless you can prove culpability\". Is the victim culpable for their house being robbed because they didn't lock their door? Well, we don't frankly know. Would the robbery have happened if the door had been locked? It's completely possible. We have no proof either way.\n\nThis is why it's pointless to discuss. As for who's responsible is for the law to decide. What we are talking about here is what the victim can do to make themselves safer from future crimes. Which is somehow construed as victim blaming. We aren't saying \"the victim's actions forced the crime to take place\". We are saying \"the victim can take certain actions to reduce the chance of being a victim.\"\n\n&gt;That is the exact moment where victim blaming occurs. These assumptions. A person makes an argument on the assumption that the robbery would not have occurred if the door had been locked, despite no proof. \n\nNot quite, they make the assumption that the robbery has a less chance of happening if the door is locked. Which is statically true.\n\n&gt;We assume the woman was raped because she was wearing a short dress. \n\nFalse assumption, but sure. I'd agree it's important to note what actually contributes to the causes, rather than what we perceive it to be.\n\n&gt;We assume the guy was mugged because of the money clip. \n\nPeople get mugged for money. People flashing around money are mugged more often. Thus, flashing around money makes you have a higher chance of getting mugged. Avoid flashing around money, and you'll reduce the chance you get mugged.\n\nIt's not that simply doing the act of pulling out money makes you automatically get mugged. But that it's tempting to criminals, and definitely increases the risk of a mugging.\n\n&gt;We have no proof of any of these assumptions\n\nSure we do. We have research/statistics that show that locks decrease burglars, 'looking poor' decreases muggings, etc. I think the \"short dress\" thing is the only one unfounded. IIRC, most rapes are done by people they are familiar with, so clothing isn't as much of an issue.\n\n&gt;Can we discuss these things? Wearing a short dress, carrying a money clip, locking your door? YES. Of course we can. But not in regards to the specific victim, because we have no proof they are related.\n\nRight. But we cans suggest these things as future actions to take to reduce risk. Not saying that's what prompted the event (naturally). But it might be a contributing cause that can be reduced or removed.\n\n&gt;Involving the specific victim shifts the entire discussion away from the root of the problem, as you said!\n\nTrue. The specific victim isn't all that important to the discussion, other than to look at what *actually* was a cause. The \"victim blaming\" is mostly (from what I see) trying to give this advice *to* the victim. Not saying it caused it, but saying \"hey, don't flash money around. Not saying you did, but it's a good thing to keep in mind if you don't want to be mugged.\"\n\nNaturally if you say \"you're dumb for flashing money around.\" that's bad, not useful, etc. The implication is the above sentence, but it comes out as victim blaming and assuming that was the cause (when it might not have been).\n\nAnd I think this is the real issue. People who call out victim blaming see the latter. The people who get called victim blamers attempt to do the former and sometimes appear as the latter.\n\nBut sometimes it's a specific cause. Person walked into X street and got mugged. X street is known to have a lot of muggings. Giving them advice to stay away from X street is good advice, and probably a core reason they (in particular) got mugged. Of course the mugger is the criminal and the sole cause (he was gonna mug someone regardless), but the victim can reduce their risk by avoiding X street.\n\n&gt;I can say \"That's an unsafe neighborhood, we shouldn't carry expensive things around with us.\" That is an intelligent reasonable discussion on personal safety that does not include the victim in any regard. The two issues are separated and now the conversation is valuable.\n\nI think this is what OP is trying to get at. Perhaps it's not the exact reason things happened, but it's a probable cause, and giving that advice to the victim might help them in the future.\n\nBut I agree, simply blaming the victim isn't helpful.",

Saying \"Mary really shouldn't\" is victim blaming. It doesn't matter how that sentence ends.\n\nDid Mary make a mistake? Sure. She was in an unsafe area. But people make mistakes, shit happens, etc. Let's have a discussion about that unsafe area and unsafe areas in general, not about Mary. There are plenty of reasons Mary could have been in an unsafe area, including simply not knowing the area is unsafe. Did Mary make mistakes, not have the right preparation, could have done something different? Sure. So could any victim of any crime. Let's talk about preparations the average person can make. Let's talk about what signs we should be aware of to identify unsafe places. Let's talk about the causes of crime. Let's talk about community improvement. So on and on and on.\n\n&gt;That is not something we can do much about. But we can drastically alter what our individual risk is, and in many cases lower it to near zero, by simply educating ourselves about proper self-defense measures and taking them vigilantly. \n\nWell, I disagree we can't do things about it, but it takes groups of people instead of individuals, I understand. These discussions are where those changes start, by educating ourselves and our neighbors.\n\n&gt;It is not victim blaming to tell someone \"if you do x then y becomes a much more likely result.\" \n\nCorrect. But that's not what you first said. There is a difference between \"Mary shouldn't have gone there because she will get mugged\" and \"That's not a safe area, muggings happen a lot there.\" \n\nThe first sentence makes so many assumptions. What if Mary lives there? Works there? Got lost? Got kicked out of a car? Got drugged and had her kidney removed for the black market and dumped there? Kid ran away and she's looking for him? So on and on. It directs the conversation away from the mugging and to Mary and why Mary is in the wrong. And the funny part is no one partaking in this discussion has any idea why Mary is there or what happened around this situation (because I've never provided a reason, just possibilities), yet that's the thing people keep bringing up. Mary shouldn't. Well, you don't know. \n\nThe second sentence talks about the crime, the situation, and begins a discussion on personal safety. Is it relevant to discuss bad areas (the place Mary was in)? Yes! Is it valuable to discuss ways a person can protect themselves? Yes! Is it valuable to discuss signs of danger? Yes! Is it valuable to discuss ways to avoid bad situations? Yes! That conversation is incredibly important and valuable and we should all have these conversations. Mary is not involved in these conversations, and should simply be a prompt for the dialog.",

        "text": "&gt; The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behaviour prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nIn your case you examined the causation and were fortunate enough to be in a position where you were actually able act upon it. \nBut for people who live in that area, have loved ones who live there, people who work there or go to school there or have no reasonable option but to walk through that area at certain times of the day: what would you have them do? How is you telling them \u201cwell, I was able to change my behaviour and it\u2019s prevented me from being mugged again\u201d in any way a worthwhile endeavour? I'm sure if you repeated your above quote to them, they'd be *super* appreciative. \n\nYeah, I\u2019m going to use the \u201cP\u201d word (sorry!) but your point of view comes from a position of (small p) privilege. You are fortunate enough to have a workable solution \u2013 not everyone else will be and having causation repeated to them over and over again isn\u2019t exactly helpful for them, it\u2019s demoralising and endlessly frustrating. \n\nFor a real-life example, there was a news story from Montreal a few months ago regarding a spate of sexual assaults in taxis. The police warned women to not [use taxis alone](http://www.ccla.org/rightswatch/2014/10/16/montreal-police-criticized-for-advice-to-women-in-response-to-taxi-assaults). Which is super easy for the cops to say when they aren\u2019t the ones who would be most affected by not using taxis alone. It might be fine for some people, but it kind of sucks if, say, you\u2019re a young woman who works in a bar at the other side of town and your only other option is walking home at 3am on a Saturday night. What do you have her do? Just not go to work for weeks on end? \n\nExplaining causation can be useful if you have the option to readjust. But for people who have no other realistic options: what would you have them do? \n\nTelling a turkey that is isn\u2019t a good idea to be a turkey in November doesn\u2019t help the turkey very much. \n",
        "reply_relation": "a",
        "reply_to_text": "I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 \u2013 I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don\u2019t deserve it. We like to think of our world as \u201cjust\u201d in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people \u201cDeserved\u201d what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman \u201cdeserved\u201d to be raped, but there\u2019s a certain amount of \u201cotherization\u201d and lack of empathy that goes on \u2013 a sense that \u201cwell, that wouldn\u2019t have happened to me, because I would\u2019ve been more careful\u201d. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that\u2019s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I don't live in these high-crime or dangerous areas, so it's easier for me to avoid them. If it means not walking by myself late at night, that doesn't impact my livelihood. So that's very relevant.\n\nI am reconsidering the latter of my two points, which is that it's a worthwhile endeavor. Specifically: it's not always worthwhile to explain causation to someone, because many times they know already and cannot change the situation (maybe they work or live in an unsafe area, etc.). Do you think it's a worthwhile discussion to have in general, though? Like when people say things like \"we need to have a societal conversational about X\"? I just feel like the victim blaming issue is such a sensitive topic, it makes it difficult to have intelligent conversations about it without causing offense.\n",

It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behaviour prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nIn your case you examined the causation and were fortunate enough to be in a position where you were actually able act upon it. \nBut for people who live in that area, have loved ones who live there, people who work there or go to school there or have no reasonable option but to walk through that area at certain times of the day: what would you have them do? How is you telling them \u201cwell, I was able to change my behaviour and it\u2019s prevented me from being mugged again\u201d in any way a worthwhile endeavour? I'm sure if you repeated your above quote to them, they'd be *super* appreciative. \n\nYeah, I\u2019m going to use the \u201cP\u201d word (sorry!) but your point of view comes from a position of (small p) privilege. You are fortunate enough to have a workable solution \u2013 not everyone else will be and having causation repeated to them over and over again isn\u2019t exactly helpful for them, it\u2019s demoralising and endlessly frustrating. \n\nFor a real-life example, there was a news story from Montreal a few months ago regarding a spate of sexual assaults in taxis. The police warned women to not [use taxis alone](http://www.ccla.org/rightswatch/2014/10/16/montreal-police-criticized-for-advice-to-women-in-response-to-taxi-assaults). Which is super easy for the cops to say when they aren\u2019t the ones who would be most affected by not using taxis alone. It might be fine for some people, but it kind of sucks if, say, you\u2019re a young woman who works in a bar at the other side of town and your only other option is walking home at 3am on a Saturday night. What do you have her do? Just not go to work for weeks on end? \n\nExplaining causation can be useful if you have the option to readjust. But for people who have no other realistic options: what would you have them do? \n\nTelling a turkey that is isn\u2019t a good idea to be a turkey in November doesn\u2019t help the turkey very much. \n",

There's an unfortunate tendency that I\u2019ve noticed \u2013 particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well \u2013 to blame the victims of terrible situations. We\u2019re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn\u2019t have been so drunk, or you shouldn\u2019t have been in that area of town).

Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine.

As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification.

I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

For most of human history, including recent U.S. history, this type of behavior was okay.  It was the natural consequence of a woman acting \"loose,\" and it *was* her fault.  And even in the current environment, lines can get (ugh) blurred.\n\nSo, it's valid to call for some messaging and education correcting that perception and affirming that we're in a new paradigm, where you really do need consent.\n\nI'm not saying campus anti-rape campaigns are never irrational, never go overboard, etc.  Of course they do.

Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism \u2013 overt or structural \u2013 and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I\u2019m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur \u2013 A and B \u2013 and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I\u2019m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that\u2019s not the view I\u2019m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn\u2019t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn\u2019t been walking through those areas, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged. So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I want to note I don't think this inexperience makes you a bad person or an idiot, it's just data you may not have to put into consideration. While speaking about causation can be beneficial in a vacuum, there is an overall context that may make it harmful, and when and how you discuss it can lead to it being potentially more damaging than helpful.\n\nWhen I entered my friend's room after they called me about being assaulted, I found them sobbing and repeating to themself \"I'm so stupid.\" They had invited someone they didn't know very well into their room - something just about everyone I've known has done multiple times - and, in this case, it turned out for the worst.\n\nIf someone had come in and said to my friend, \"well, inviting someone into your room is a risky thing to do,\" then I wouldn't be frustrated with that person because they were wrong, I would be frustrated with them because they were being emotionally inconsiderate. Yes, there were logical decisions on my friend's part that put them at risk, but my friend is already dealing with emotionally damaging self-blaming and self-loathing, and this just throws fuel on the fire. When someone is unable to leave a room for 3 weeks because of waking up in the middle of the night sobbing and having flashbacks, you pointing out how they could have lessened their chance of this occurring is not on the top of the list of things that need to be addressed. Later, when that person is speaking with a trusted therapist who can unwind causality from self-blame, is a more appropriate context to discuss the the issue with that person.\n\nI'd equate it to walking up to someone whose dog was hit by a car and saying, \"dog-chains will keep the dog away from the street and make it less likely to be hit by a car.\" You're not logically wrong, but you're not really helping. By pointing out the causality to the owner - who is likely already blaming themself - you're likely hurting them more than your information is worth. In addition, you're not fully informed; for all you know, the owner's last dog strangled itself on its chain, and he just put in a fence that the new dog dug under. This is why there are commenters in this thread who are saying people are being unempathetic; they're not seeing the emotional context of the event, and just focusing on the logical context - considering the causality in a vacuum instead of as part of a whole incident. Again, this is not because they're stupid, but because they likely have never had a full context on an issue like this before.\n\nThis is not to say that conversations shouldn't be had about dangerous areas, or that people shouldn't be warned about dangerous activities; those things lead to better-informed citizens and better policing, as well as other endeavors such as improved lighting for areas that are high-crime. However, there needs to be a question of when and with whom that conversation should be had; in cases like sexual assualt, I think the causation argument should be had with the therapist.

So we don\u2019t walk through those areas at night anymore. It\u2019s still possible that we\u2019ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we\u2019ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn\u2019t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It\u2019s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it\u2019s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we\u2019ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they\u2019re not, so we don\u2019t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to us, so that we don\u2019t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there\u2019s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You keep trying to make it out to be a fixation, when I gave you the reason.\n\n&gt; Nobody said that a person walking down a sidewalk is a cause for being hit by a car. Nowhere is that mentioned. At all.\n\nI created the hypothetical situation to illustrate a point; of course nobody mentioned it. Had people already considered this situation, I would not have needed to create the hypothetical.\n\n&gt; That person is not a cause in your scenario.\n\nI'm glad you got the point of the hypothetical. The person on the sidewalk is not a cause, even though their action (being present) was a minor contribution to what happened. This is just like how a person on the street isn't a cause for their mugging, even though they happened to be present at the same time as the mugger.\n\n&gt; The whole point of this topic is that causes should be examined to see what did and did not contribute. You keep making up scenarios just to point out things that are not a cause. \n\nAnd I'm explaining that these things happen irrespective of what the OP considers causes. Both locked and unlocked houses get robbed, and the vast majority of unlocked houses *don't* get robbed. To say not locking a door caused a robbery is simply wrong.",

Am I misinterpreting you in some way?\n\nOP's view is that explaining causation and how to prevent problems is currently called 'victim-blaming' but shouldn't. Primarily because it's useful discussion on how to protect the victim in the future, as well as get rid of the problem.\n\nOP thinks 'victim-blaming' should be considered stuff like \"don't be an idiot' which doesn't contribute at all, and simply harasses the victim.\n\nI agree. 'victim-blaming' in this sense is bad/wrong/not useful. In the sense that many people use it (explaining causation, which may be due to the victim's actions) is important discussion, and that the victims should still use caution.\n\nPrimarily I think people should pay more attention to risks. if you see a high risk thing, or don't pay attention to it and do it anyway, you are partly at fault. You did a high-risk activity. You don't have anyone but yourself to blame when that risk happens.\n\nBut simply pointing out how stupid someone is isn't helpful. What *is* is to provide more information, perhaps they didn't figure out the right risk and it's much higher than they thought. Perhaps they simply didn't take a precaution that they could have. Pointing this stuff out helps prevent future problems in similar situations.\n\n'victim-blaming' shouldn't be mentioned at all. Who's 'fault' it is doesn't particularly matter.

Of course the mugger causes the mugging; but if changing your behavior in a certain way reduces the chance of getting mugged, why not do it?\n\nYou can take measures to reduce your risk, but failure to reduce risk is not causing something to happen. At what point have you sufficiently reduced risk to remove your causal contribution? Let's take a fatal car accident (other driver at fault):\n\n* Is wearing a seatbelt enough?\n* Driving a big, heavy car?\n* Only driving on empty streets?\n\nIs the only way to prevent \"causing\" your fatal accident to not drive at all? It's easy to point to the things you are willing to avoid, and say others ought not have done them. If you work downtown and don't get off until late, is it reasonable to have them stay overnight in the office? Is the fact that they have that job the reason they got mugged?\n\n&gt; You dismiss it as a \"minor contribution\" to the cause. But if there are certain precautions one might take in order to protect themselves, why not take them?\n\nHow many precautions are enough? It's reasonable to take the precaution of not going on message boards and talking about rape fantasies. Is it reasonable to cover up as if you were in the middle east just so a man won't rape you? That is the justification for how the women dress; it's that their dress evokes urges in men.\n\n&gt; Throughout your response, you continually use \"blame\" language: \"at fault\", \"full blame\", etc., when I never placed any blame on the victim.\n\nI'm not sure you can separate cause and blame. Your sentiment is essentially \"if you hadn't been doing x, then y would not have happened\". You can dress it up by saying it's cause and not blame, but it is blame.\n\n&gt; Let's be realistic here. There are certain legitimate circumstances that are more dangerous. So if you avoid putting yourself in them, you might avoid danger. That doesn't mean you \"deserve\" a bad outcome if you do put yourself in those situations.\n\nWearing a revealing outfit is a dangerous activity? The vast majority of women wearing revealing outfits are not raped, yet, that is trotted out when a women in a revealing outfit happens to be raped. If they aren't wearing a revealing outfit, we pick another reason (out late at night, at a party, drinking, etc). The point is people do these things safely the overwhelming majority of the time. The reason they were raped is that circumstances *beyond their control* put them in the wrong place at the wrong time. You can dress conservatively, not drink, not go out, not party, and what life do you have now?",
