One of the examples listed could clearly have a benefit in any place where estrogen therapy would have a benefit. So, with a careful enough utilization, these oils could have actual health benefits for certain conditions. Otherwise they are a dangerous placebo choice. For instance, marijuana is derived from the Cannabis family of plants. It could easily be provided in an "essential oil" form.

Basically, "essential oils" are simply a re-branding of drugs (which started as a re-branding of herbs to distinguish the amount of study that went into creating them).</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt;OP's view regards whether these discussions need to be considered "victim blaming." Your position seems to be that it is victim blaming and that's okay. Am I misinterpreting you in some way?

OP's view is that explaining causation and how to prevent problems is currently called 'victim-blaming' but shouldn't. Primarily because it's useful discussion on how to protect the victim in the future, as well as get rid of the problem.

OP thinks 'victim-blaming' should be considered stuff like "don't be an idiot' which doesn't contribute at all, and simply harasses the victim.

I agree. 'victim-blaming' in this sense is bad/wrong/not useful. In the sense that many people use it (explaining causation, which may be due to the victim's actions) is important discussion, and that the victims should still use caution.

Primarily I think people should pay more attention to risks. if you see a high risk thing, or don't pay attention to it and do it anyway, you are partly at fault. You did a high-risk activity. You don't have anyone but yourself to blame when that risk happens.

But simply pointing out how stupid someone is isn't helpful. What *is* is to provide more information, perhaps they didn't figure out the right risk and it's much higher than they thought. Perhaps they simply didn't take a precaution that they could have. Pointing this stuff out helps prevent future problems in similar situations.

'victim-blaming' shouldn't be mentioned at all. Who's 'fault' it is doesn't particularly matter. What matters is what caused it, which might be causes on the victim's part. Whether or not that means the victim is at fault is irrelevant.</data>

      <data key="d0">I can't remember the topic that spurred this discussion, but a friend and I were debating whether man-made things were natural. He took the position that they are unnatural. 

He cited this definition by Merriam-Webster:  existing in nature and not made or caused by people : coming from nature (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural) as his basis for the distinction for natural vs. unnatural.

However, I respectfully disagree with his position and furthermore that definition of natural. People arise from nature. Humankind's capacity to create, problem-solve, analyze, rationalize, and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural? It is only through natural occurrences that we have this ability, why is it that we would give the credit of these things solely to man, as opposed to nature? We are not separate from nature, thus, how can any of our actions or creations be unnatural? If we were somehow separate from nature, I would understand the distinction between natural and man-made. However, I think unnatural and man-made are not synonyms by any means. It seems to me that man-made things MUST be natural due to our being part of nature. 

I would love to hear your arguments and to have my view changed if I am mistaken in my logic somewhere along the line.

EDIT: Thanks for your responses lads. As many of you pointed out, our argument depends more on the context of the use of the word and I think that my friend and I were arguing about the semantics and definition more than our intended meaning behind use of the word "natural".</data>

No, it's just an observation about how you keep dragging rape into almost every reply you've made in this thread, even when almost none of the comments you're replying to mention rape.

Nobody said that a person walking down a sidewalk is a cause for being hit by a car. Nowhere is that mentioned. At all. That person is *not a cause* in your scenario. In the other scenario mentioned, jaywalking near a blind hill, then they are. The whole point of this topic is that causes should be examined to see what did and did not contribute. You keep making up scenarios just to point out things that are not a cause. It's a strawman argument at best.

I said locking your door can reduce your risk of being robbed. If someone "breaks in", then they have "broken" something (door, lock, window, etc) to get in. If you want to be pedantic, locks "cause" break-ins.

Are people who buy homes around golf courses not expecting more broken windows or bad shots breaking other items? Will they act totally surprised when it happens and are they justified? Are they victims?

Let's use noise pollution, instead, as it's more true.

Are people who live down town expecting the same peace and quiet someone who lives outside of the core will receive?

What of people who live next to airports, do they have a right to move in then complain about the airport noise?

No one should be attacked, that's the idea, but that's not reality. 

The mugger mugging you is actually NOT the cause. That is merely the karmic reaction of multiple decisions and actions that have occurred towards the mugger. The mugger is mugging someone due to other reasons. They aren't just mugging for the sake of mugging, the karma does not start there nor does it end there.

Someone walking down a shitty street and they know it's shitty isn't actually putting themselves in a good position. They do not deserve to be attacked, but in terms of increasing their chances, they are not doing themselves favors.</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt;Real crime happens all the time when you would least expect it.

Yes exactly, the example I give was an example of someone making themselves a more prominent target.

I'm well aware there isn't a *muggers lane* but there are spots and positions people put themselves in that make them not only an easier target for criminals but a more desirable target as well.

If a criminal is going to go after someone and they have a choice between the dude dressed as a bum and the well dressed women with her purse loosely dangling from her arm.  They're going to go after the women.  For them not only is their a higher odds of it being more lucrative, but purses are easier for a snatch and grab.

Lot of crime is random and lots of crime is targeted. The point is to catch and stop all the criminals yes, but there's also a point as to try and not become the victim in the first place by having self awareness of how you appear, act and where you are.

&amp;gt; Real crime happens all the time when you would least expect it.


Ya that's the point of crime, if we expected after all we'd be able to properly deal with it, but we don't know when or how to expect it.  So ideally the intelligent thing to do is to make yourself into the least desirable target so you can hopefully expect it less.</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt; Your being mugged is a statistical outcome

This is absolutely true, but I don't think it really does anything to undermine the overall point.  For example, if I leave an open briefcase full of stacks of cash on the Bronx-bound subway, what good does my response of "but yeah, it was only a statistical outcome!" do in reply to someone saying that was a dumb decision on my part after it comes up missing?  Yes, everything is a statistical outcome, from walking down the street, to playing russian roulette with only one chamber empty.  That trivial observation does not somehow remove our ability to talk about causation though, because the statistics *inform* intelligent decisions generally.  The statistic that I have a 5 in 6 chance of losing that russian roulette game is what makes playing so stupid.  

So it would seem that your reply is really only making the point that times when it's appropriate are limited to when the risk is sufficiently high, which is agreeable enough, but that doesn't somehow lead to the conclusion that you can *never* criticize victims for what they did, which it seems would have to be the conclusion to really be at odds with the OP.</data>

Hell, someone managed to shoot up the Navy Yard in DC.  I would wager that a few people around there were carrying guns.  

Now, you could use this incident to point out that strict gun laws are obviously incapable of stopping mass shooting events, since one just happened in a place with said laws, but I don't think you can say that more relaxed laws would have stopped it.

I think the lesson to be learned between this AND the United States is that the occurrence of mass shootings is actually pretty independent of a place's gun culture.  Just as guns can't stop it from happening, banning them obviously can't either.</data>

Show me one of those facts.

It is simple logic that the more legal guns in a society, the more illegal guns that will exist. It's also quite obvious that normal civiliants with guns are going to be little better at defending themselves than unarmed civilians, and that the responsibility of dealing with terrorists or any other type of criminal is that of law enforcement.

I'd rather have 10 more well trained firearms teams than 100,000 more armed civilians. Maybe I'm wrong though, maybe you can show me some kind of statistical correlation between lax gun controls and crime rates.

There are lies, dam lies and statistics sadly though, so I'm sure we could each punch holes in the others data, but at least then we'd be moving the debate forward.

If you see someone "disregarding" a risk, ask yourself whether they actually don't know about the risk, or whether they know about it, and have chosen to brave it because this benefits them in some way (i.e. keeping your guard up in public all the time is exhausting, and music is nice).

That neither true, nor does it make any sense. Yes, you might decide that you want to eat pasta instead of pizza but that's all product of your brain, which is a product of evolution and hence nature.

&amp;gt; The things produced by humans fall pretty solidly under commonly accepted definitions of the word unnatural. 

Which makes no sense. That's the whole point of what OP was arguing against. 

&amp;gt; But the point of words is to express nuance. 

But you then you shouldn't use the word 'natural'. Natural comes from nature. 

&amp;gt; Nature, in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the natural, physical, or material world or universe.

If someone say 'this is unnatural' it's the same as saying 'this is not from this universe'. But clearly things humans create are part of the universe/nature.

&amp;gt; You could frankly just simplify everything in this way.

What? No, that makes no sense. I think you're confusing the word 'unnatural' with 'manmade'. 

&amp;gt; "Look at that collection of subatomic particles interacting with that other collection of subatomic particles!"

Can we please stop the bullshit about subatomic particles... this is a discussion about a logical mistake in the use of a word. I don't know where you get the absurd idea from that we can define anything anymore if we don't accept natural simply means 'everything'.

&amp;gt; We invented them to describe the universe as we perceive it. 

I don't think you know what nature means. 

&amp;gt; Thus, some humans have deemed it necessary to draw a distinction between things created by humans and everything else.

WTF!? There are already words for that e.g. manmade. Are you on drugs or something? Also where do you draw the distinction anyway? Is organic food unnatural?

That's diametrically opposed to OP's stated view (though, I suspect, not to his actual underlying view). 

The vast, vast, majority of times when someone calls "explaining causation" "victim blaming" are, in fact, unjustified and unwarranted victim blaming. 

You really won't very often hear someone say it's "victim blaming" if you tell a person who fell while balancing on the wall of the Grand Canyon that he was an idiot. 

Among other things... they aren't really victims, because they weren't victimized. 

In cases where someone else chose to victimize someone, "explaining causality" is in almost all cases unjustified victim blaming. Anyone that actually spends the rather large effort it would take to define precisely the expected cost of the victim's specific behaviors vs. the costs of not doing what they did is almost certainly being disingenuous if they say that's all they're doing. </data>

      <data key="d0">"Causation" is a very deep, complex topic, and when people who are "explaining causation" are accused of victim blaming, it's usually because they've taken an approach to causation which is unhelpful, oversimplified, or which misses the important points.

If we consider a hypothetical violent crime and ask, "why did this happen?" it's tempting to think we can boil this question down to one or two or three "main" causes. Let's say:

1) Jamie was a habitual violent criminal  
2) Jamie happened to be in Central Park looking for victims  
3) Pat chose to walk through Central Park that night  
4) Pat was unarmed, listening to headphones and not cultivating a lot of situational awareness  

Now, which of these causes is the *real* reason for the assault? What would it even *mean* to say that one of these is a more real, or more important, cause than the others? It seems to me that, as "cause and effect" are popularly conceived, we want to be able to set up one-to-one relationships between effects and causes, as if history were some sort of sequential chain.

In reality, every single one of these conditions is a necessary condition for this assault to take place. If you removed any single one of these "causes", the encounter would have happened differently, or not at all. There isn't a "chain" of preceding causes for a given event, there's an infinitely branching family tree of causal ancestors.

And in addition to these four causes, there are countless others which we didn't have time to list, such as:

5) there were no police officers in visual range at the moment when Jamie and Pat crossed paths  
6) Jamie didn't sprain an ankle going downstairs for breakfast that morning  
7) Pat wasn't struck by a meteorite on the way to the park  
8) A butterfly flapped its wings a few weeks ago

So none of this is news, and I think we're all pretty familiar with the idea that the future is a great big mess of intersecting and mutually-interfering causes, effects, and conditions, which can only be navigated probabilistically and heuristically. Our decisions about *which* causes and effects to focus on, in order to bring about the sorts of outcomes we want, must be motivated accordingly. The question which matters is not "do victims ever *cause* their own victimization?", because the answer to that is trivially yes. I can avoid car accidents by staying in bed all day every day, and in that sense, I am the "cause" of anything which *ever* happens to me, by virtue of the fact that I chose to get up and get dressed that day.

The more meaningful question to ask, is "whose behaviour can be changed, and how, in order to optimize expected outcomes?" I could easily avoid car accidents if nothing else mattered to me, but I have places to go and people to see so I make compromises, cross streets, and even jaywalk sometimes for my own convenience. None of this is reason to conclude that I don't know cars are dangerous.

The people who get accused of victim-blaming, IMHO, have usually failed to consider or address this second question in any meaningful or novel way - and the fact that they bother to express their thoughts on the topic *at all*, usually carries with it an implicit (and very condescending) assumption that the recipient of their 'helpful advice', the person actually *facing* the risk, hasn't already given the question any deep consideration of their own. Women are *well aware* that there are rapists out there. Black people are *painfully cognizant* of the fact that police departments have a racism problem. If anyone is acting, to your eye, as if they didn't know this was the case, the misunderstanding is almost certainly on your end.

There is nobody out there saying "Oh wow! I never realized I could make myself safer by voluntarily refraining from some of the fun, risky behaviours which other people engage in!" Most of the time they're aware of the risk, and they have been forced into a dilemma of choosing some compromise between freedom and safety *when they were supposed to have both*. When something bad happens, there will *always, always always* be someone around to say "well you could have made yourself 5% less likely to be targeted by doing X", and the only way to *not* receive this kind of useless advice from someone, would be to stay home all day every day. And if you die unscathed, poor and lonely after a lifetime of playing it safe, *even then*, there will be others who advise you to "live a little!" and observe that you could have created a better life for yourself by taking more risks.

It's not "victim blaming" to observe that victims have opportunities to reduce the risks they face, but it's condescending to imagine that you have better insights into how to do this than they do, or to assume that the reason they don't is that they just didn't know they could.</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt;While this may be a technically accurate description of "cause", is it at all a useful one?

Sure. And many gun control arguments use this. "More restrictions on who can own a gun means less gun deaths". Rather than put the focus on the criminal (or the misuser) they put it on the distributors of guns.

Naturally, more checks might reduce problematic ownership. But perhaps not.

As far as the victim being part of the cause, there's definitely some fixes, at least from their perspective. You can lower those incidents by avoiding situations in which they occur. Don't hang around guns, and your chance of getting shot lowers. Be a gun lover and it raises. It's not that you'd intentionally shoot yourself, but rather pure probability. Being around guns increases the chance you'll be shot. If you are okay with that, then hang around guns. If not, then don't. That's fully within a person's ability.

The knife salesman could realize his knifes are used as weapons, and make them not as sharp. or perhaps switch to selling butter knives. Or maybe not sell to sketchy people.

&amp;gt;So the sun, earth, and moon are also causes. But in what way is that significant?

Right. Environment can definitely be a part. Say a terrorist hijacks a plane and flies into a storm with the intention of crashing. Had you not flown when there was a storm, that couldn't have happened. No storm, no storm to crash into.

The point is that they are still causes and factors. Using this, the victim can be alerted of these, and perhaps make better decisions if they don't want to be mugged.

Just like it's useful to know car crashes are one of the leading causes of death. People will still ignore it, but perhaps drive more safely. Or maybe avoid cars all together and take the subway.

&amp;gt;Are you really that much more likely to be mugged on the wrong side of the tracks?

It's hard to say without a specific incident. Generally this stuff is encapsulated by "common sense", but "common sense" is not something some people have. Other times it might be misguided (like slutty clothing causing rapes).

&amp;gt; Really, does anyone have a statistic on this? 

Not for "being in dark alleys is bad". But perhaps "X street has a lot of gun shootings, avoid there". Particularly look at San Francisco. Practically every other street has a clear level of criminal activity. You avoid the 'bad' streets, and walk along the good ones. You can certainly walk along the bad streets and be fine. But there's simply a higher chance of, say, getting your backpack snagged while walking on certain streets. You can look at crime maps. It's pretty clear where most of the crimes occur, and where is safe.

Also knowing that there's a lot of car break ins might make you wary of owning a car (or keeping anything valuable in it). This information helps inform decision making.

&amp;gt;because the victim has no control over where the mugger/rapist is, so his or her choice to walk down a street is not really a meaningful factor.

This may be true if there's no significant data for individual streets/areas. But it works on a general scale too. Living in a city with more crime means there's a higher chance of you being involved. If you live in a place with little to no crime, that chance reduces dramatically.

It's still a factor, and one that may or may not be able to be controlled, depending on the situation. </data>

      <data key="d0">OP didn't say anything was "never" anything. Indeed his explanation explicitly says that sometimes it *is* X (victim blaming). We can only really take OPs view as being that as a general statement that most often explaining causation isn't victim blaming, especially since he goes on to say it's a worthwhile exercise (which we can only assume means "in general").

In the face of such a view, raising extreme examples doesn't really serve any purpose. OP isn't talking about extreme cases, he's talking about ordinary cases. 

As for how risky people think jumping into a lion cage is, I strong suspect that they vastly overestimate the danger of that activity. Is it risky? Sure, but what good does it do to tell someone mauled by a lion that it was risky if you can't say *how* risky with even a slight pretense to accuracy? It *obviously* was risky. There's no conceivable way that they don't know this. 

If your goal is to educate and inform, then you need information about the actual levels of risk, because only with that kind of information can someone make a valid assessment of the risks and rewards. 

I think it's safe to presume that someone that jumps into a lion cage either wants to die, in which case this entire point is moot, or gains some significant personal reward from it that they consider to be worth the risk, in spite of their probably inflated idea of what this risk is. 

Similarly, with walking in a "dangerous" neighborhood. They have some idea of what the value of choosing that path is. Unless you have a better idea of the risk than they do, it does no good to tell them that it's "risky". 

Everything is "risky". Everyone knows that. Unless you have useful information to impart, you're not educating... wait for it...

      <data key="d0">Consider the definition of a prime number. It's a number that is divisible only by itself and 1. 

This is the usual definition given, but by this definition it could be argued that 1 is itself a prime number. After all, it's divisible by itself. And it's also divisible by 1. The two things it needs to be divisible by just happen to be the same thing. So for this reason, there's an additional restriction: 1 is not a prime number.

Why is that? It's a completely arbitrary restriction. We just threw on a clause at the end that stated 1 isn't prime. It should be prime! So why isn't it?

Because it's not useful. 

Primes are useful because with them we can do things like construct *unique* prime factorization for example. The prime factorization of 12 is 2, 2, 3 because `2 * 2 * 3 = 12`. But if we allowed 1 to be prime, then we no long have unique prime factorization. We'd also have 1, 2, 2, 3, as well as 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, and so on. This is just one example where limiting the definition of what a prime is can be useful. 

So now back to the definition of 'natural'. Yes, the distinction between man made thing and natural things is arbitrary. But we make the distinction because it's useful for categorizing things. We didn't derive the definition from some set of core axioms. We arbitrarily added the clause "Not made by humans" so that we could distinguish between things made by people and things done without the influence of people. While we are, in a sense, not separate from nature, we are in a somewhat unique position relative to the rest of nature, so it makes sense to have language we can use to make that distinction.</data>

The problem with this response is that you are shifting from Victim blaming to bystandard blaming.  You are swapping from "Mary" to "news/the police/the community" that they should "do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area."

That is much like blaming the CIA for the 9/11 disaster, for not averting it.

&amp;gt;Does the second response not completely cover both your requirements? 

Actually no.  "That's a really unsafe area." doesn't provide valuable information.  It doesn't give the nature of the problems with safety.  It doesn't specify to what crimes are prone to happen in the area, nor the demographics of the affected individuals.

You can't stop all crime, you can just lower your odds, and even that isn't perfect.  

You can say:

I am sorry that X happened to you.  Remember, it isn't your fault.  In addition to trying to affect this area as a community to either make it easier to make this place safer.  Here are some information that will lower your chances so that you can possibly avoid this in the future.

Remember, this isn't your fault.

What do I really do? If I have entered a violent confrontation with someone, then I have already failed. I either avoid such things or solve them diplomatically.

Let's say I have failed already. Well, then I suppose I would dissolve the situation to the best of my ability, ending it as fast as possible or with the least amount of harm to anyone. Would shooting someone be the fastest way? Yes, but it would likely also impart the most harm. Sure there are other ways of killing someone or maiming them without a gun but it is less likely then.

You must be wondering, then, what do I do if I am being threatened by someone with a gun? Since every situation is different, it's impossible to say. Getting into specifics doesn't really matter if it's with a gun or something else. One specific thing I guess I could say is that I feel like I would be in much higher danger if I had a gun.

Avoiding danger and being safe is the only plan. Every situation is different.

This isn't such an easy issue, though. I can't just say "don't get shot" and be done with it. Unfortunately, the issue is festering and corrupt as it is. We train people to use guns to kill other people. It's one of the most philosophically ridiculous things to exist in our society. There are jobs out there that have the description of giving death to other things.

Because people can see guns as a way to kill other people, the fear will not fade. To not be afraid is to be blind to the issue.

Eventually people may not see guns as a way to kill other people (for whatever reason, please don't argue that this can't happen as that argument would be completely unrelated.) Then it won't matter if someone has a gun.

Not in our lifetime!

In summary, it is best that the situation in which to defend myself never arises.</data>

In a way they are. Though 9/11 would be difficult to predict. No real way to minimize risk. Perhaps not work in a well known building?

&amp;gt;and a child who is molested is to blame for their molestation.

Depends on the actions really. For children it's a bit more difficult, as their minds and decision making abilities haven't developed, and they are smaller/weaker physically. They also have a "must follow authority" mindset, which makes them more susceptible to abuse.

But if you take a teenager (still child molestation), there's a chance the teenager initiated the conduct and the adult followed through.

Children also don't have much control over where they can go and what they can do. So again it's much more difficult to minimize risks (and depending on the kid, they might not even realize there's a risk in the first place).</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt;Oh, right, I forgot poor people are responsible for being assaulted if they live in a dangerous area! 

Poor people are commonly more aggressive, more violence focused, have worse money and risk management skills, less critical thinking, and have a high chance of being gang-associated.

Alternatively, if you are poor, you still have the choice of not settling down in a crap area, moving out into bumsfuck hicksville, and living a decent life there.

Even *if* you live in a bad area, there's still ways to avoid being assaulted. When I flew to SF, I knew I was going to be in a bad area, so I made sure I minimized the risk. I got a ride from the airport to the hotel, instead of taking the subway and walking. I made sure not to be out at night. I made sure to not wear earbuds so I could pay attention to my surroundings. I walked quickly, being sure to avoid eye contact and proximity with sketchy individuals. I made sure to be on the move early, ,when most people were still asleep. And so on. Did anything bad happen? Nope. Could something bad have happened? Absolutely, especially if I wasn't careful. Considering it's one of the more crime ridden areas of SF. I knew the statistics, and took care to avoid those situations.

Naturally I could've chose to not go, and stay home in my safer location. Hell, I almost didn't get a room, and would've been kicked out onto the streets.

But everything went fine, because I was cautious and planned out my moves.

&amp;gt;So, what, if Mary is trying to walk home one day and she gets attacked we should all tell her it's her fault for living there? 

Yes and no. Naturally if she didn't live there, that wouldn't have happened. But there's many other things that lead up to it as well.

&amp;gt;What if she's a child who was born there?

Again, she still has the freedom to act in safe ways. Though her general location would be her parent's fault (Why aren't they there with her?).

&amp;gt;Also, why do you persist in believing that someone who is attacked just isn't taking any steps whatsoever to protect her own safety? 

Because it wasn't stated. If you are in a dark alley, in a sketchy part of town, and get mugged, I have to ask what you are doing in that dark alley.  The amount of crimes in a public well-lit space, like inside a police station, is minimal. Hanging out in a police station all day is arguably safe and there's a good chance you won't get mugged there.

&amp;gt;What if Mary is carrying mace, but it doesn't help her?

This solution implies you ignore the risk, but carry self-defense in case bad things happen. Which means you anticipated the thing to happen. This situation could've been prevented with better thinking and planning.

&amp;gt;What if the mugger uses it against her? 

See above.

&amp;gt; Is she still "responsible" for her attack, or does she get a pass for trying to defend herself -- even if she gets hurt worse for it?

Both parties are responsible. One simply initiated. Had either party not been there, the mugging would not happen. If the mugger was in AA, and Mary was at a public mall in a well-lit space, there'd be no mugging at all!

If the mugger was there, an Mary was in a police station. There'd *still* be no mugging! This means Mary was a direct cause of Mary being mugged. Which means she can alter her actions to reduce the chance of that event.

She can't, however, change the actions of the mugger. So if I were mary, i'd avoid wherever I'd think a mugger would be. Or at least be sure to go with a group.</data>

Walking in a bad part of town at night is considered dangerous, not being the person liable to be mugged is morally culpable for that, but because a reasonable person who values their own safety wouldn't do it. It is the reason many legal actions necessitate a "reasonable" aspect. The world demands reason to be described accurately, and saying that walking though a bad part of town is totally fine because only the injustice of others can bring you down is stupid. If I am afraid of dying then skydiving isn't the right thing for me, because it is risky. I can't assume blaming the person who packed the parachute will make things right.

Of course this is correct; I specifically said something along those lines in the original statement. We ought to work towards a world in which this is the case. However, our world is not currently like this, unfortunately. As u/gomboloid says above, a productive discussion can result from saying something like: "I got mugged at this part of town, maybe you should avoid going there at this time of night". Of course the mugger causes the mugging; but if changing your behavior in a certain way reduces the chance of getting mugged, why not do it? 

You dismiss it as a "minor contribution" to the cause. But if there are certain precautions one might take in order to protect themselves, why not take them?

Yes, the "full blame" lies with the perpetrator. Like I said, this isn't a question of justification. This is a touchy issue, and people are often unable to think about these things in a rational way because they're afraid of implying some sort of justification. My first view is "explaining causation does not imply justification". Throughout your response, you continually use "blame" language: "at fault", "full blame", etc., when I never placed any blame on the victim. 

"You can play the game of circumstances until you can't do anything without being at fault."
Let's be realistic here. There are certain legitimate circumstances that are more dangerous. So if you avoid putting yourself in them, you might avoid danger. That doesn't mean you "deserve" a bad outcome if you do put yourself in those situations. </data>

it took me a lot of time to work through thoughts that the world was an unjust place. like a looong time and a lot of effort. so most people don't bother and tell themselves, nothing bad has happened to me, it must be fine - which means they need to explain anything bad that happens to anyone else as their fault.

the idea that people _want to believe_ it's just and will justify bad shit that happens to other people - i'm not sure if i'd thought about it from that perspective before. thanks for makin' me think.

 The only explanation I could think of for calling humanity and it's creations unnatural would be that we are intelligent enough to understand that we are changing our environment.

Overall, I think it depends on how you are defining "natural" in terms of relativity. Relative to the earth's environment, humans do some "unnatural" things. However, relative to the entirety of the universe, humans are unable to do anything unnatural i.e not breaking the laws of physics.

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt; The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behaviour prevented us from getting mugged again.

In your case you examined the causation and were fortunate enough to be in a position where you were actually able act upon it. 
But for people who live in that area, have loved ones who live there, people who work there or go to school there or have no reasonable option but to walk through that area at certain times of the day: what would you have them do? How is you telling them “well, I was able to change my behaviour and it’s prevented me from being mugged again” in any way a worthwhile endeavour? I'm sure if you repeated your above quote to them, they'd be *super* appreciative. 

Yeah, I’m going to use the “P” word (sorry!) but your point of view comes from a position of (small p) privilege. You are fortunate enough to have a workable solution – not everyone else will be and having causation repeated to them over and over again isn’t exactly helpful for them, it’s demoralising and endlessly frustrating. 

For a real-life example, there was a news story from Montreal a few months ago regarding a spate of sexual assaults in taxis. The police warned women to not [use taxis alone](http://www.ccla.org/rightswatch/2014/10/16/montreal-police-criticized-for-advice-to-women-in-response-to-taxi-assaults). Which is super easy for the cops to say when they aren’t the ones who would be most affected by not using taxis alone. It might be fine for some people, but it kind of sucks if, say, you’re a young woman who works in a bar at the other side of town and your only other option is walking home at 3am on a Saturday night. What do you have her do? Just not go to work for weeks on end? 

Explaining causation can be useful if you have the option to readjust. But for people who have no other realistic options: what would you have them do? 

Telling a turkey that is isn’t a good idea to be a turkey in November doesn’t help the turkey very much.

&amp;gt;But everything went fine, because I was cautious and planned out my moves.

*Not.*

Everything went fine because you were lucky and the chance of being attacked is incredibly low, even in dangerous places. Do you think every single person who is attacked is just an idiot who isn't being cautious? Boy do I have news for you! Most people who are assaulted, raped, or murdered are victims of people they already know. In many cases, people they have a reason to trust, like friends and close family. But they aren't *smart* like you, so it's their fault. Similarly, if you'd been attacked, you'd be crying that it was unfair and not your fault, but you're quick to assume everyone else is a complete dumbfuck who doesn't know how to tie his shoes, much less protect his safety. Your dismissive callousness toward your fellow man and the poor is highly worrying and inaccurate.

&amp;gt;Yes and no

Sorry bud, you can't answer a "should we" question with yes and no. We either do it or we don't. If you aren't sure about your morals in this situation, don't try to debate about it.

&amp;gt;Again, she still has the freedom to act in safe ways. Though her general location would be her parent's fault (Why aren't they there with her?).

Did your mother walk you home from the bus stop when you were 15? That would actually explain a lot.

&amp;gt;The amount of crimes in a public well-lit space, like inside a police station, is minimal.

Meanwhile on /r/nottheonion, a man has his bike stolen from inside a police station. No but seriously, most crimes occur in private places, so the crimes occurring in dark alleyways are what's minimal. Your chance to be mugged is far, far lower than your chance not to be, no matter how dark the street. You are, in essence, accusing people of not forseeing something incredibly unlikely. I might as well ask why you visit your family on the holidays, since there's a statistic chance they'll rape and murder you.

&amp;gt;This solution implies you ignore the risk, but carry self-defense in case bad things happen. Which means you anticipated the thing to happen.

Not all risks can be avoided. What if there's no alternative but to go down the dark street to get home? Where I live, there are miles and miles of land with no streelights, and neighborhoods with several blocks that have no light at all. Not everyone is so fortunate as to be able to get rides everywhere, particularly poor people who can't afford the gas.

&amp;gt;If the mugger was there, an Mary was in a police station. There'd still be no mugging! This means Mary was a direct cause of Mary being mugged.

And so were her parents, so we should talk to them about how to use protection. Your argument is ridiculous. What if the mugger chooses Mary because a previous mark looked too intimidating? Is he also at fault? Let's blame the mugger's landlord for asking for rent money too, after all, if the mugger had no expenses, he wouldn't be out mugging people. You can't ignore the silly side of your argument every time you state it.

Absolutely not. The aggressor is still the one to be "blamed", in the sense that they are the only ones that ought to be punished. But fault should be attributed to anyone who made choices that knowingly put the victim in danger (including the victim themselves). Fault lies with the victim who put themselves in a needlessly risky situation, and with authorities/officials/parents/whomever who let that area get dangerous in the first place. It just so happens that *that particular victim* made choices that led to a dramatically increased risk of victimhood. Pat could have *not* gone through the park, and stuck with a route that was known to be safer.

&amp;gt;Getting drunk with strangers, particularly if you're of a physically weaker or more sexually sought-after gender or body type(Sorry mods!!!) is dangerous. Everyone knows this. No one is served by reminding anyone of it, least of all the vulnerable people doing it. They know. People do it anyway because it's fun.

I mentioned this in other comments, but that doesn't seem to be true. There are a good set of people who believe anything bad that happens to them cannot be attributable, in any part, to their actions. People who say things like "don't teach people not to leave valuables in their car, teach thieves not to steal them". Ideally, *nobody* would steal. But the nature of crime is a much harder (some would say an impossible) problem to solve than teaching people how to take precautions to prevent themselves becoming a victim.

&amp;gt;At the very least, such people are saying "You would be better off if you had X% less risk of being victimized and Y% fewer opportunities for spontaneous, free-wheeling fun in your life"

Also not useful. Taking precautions to reduce your risk of victimhood doesn't mean living a boring life. It means not intentionally doing things that are likely to make you a victim; like jaywalking a busy street, walking through a shady park at night, or leaving valuables in your car. Maybe you really love taking risks - fine. That's your bad decision to make. But it's very possible that a victim didn't even know they were making bad decisions (Maybe Pat is like me, and didn't realize the park was dangerous). It's a worthwhile endeavor to *inform them* about it, and give advice on how to avoid being a victim in the future. It doesn't mean they need to take the advice (they can be a victim as many times as they want), but what's ethically wrong from trying to help people avoid victimhood?</data>

In any way? How about *compared to other states*?

Your risk of crime in even the worst neighborhoods is actually vanishingly small. If it's triple the rate of a walking path that's a mile longer, is it worth taking the risk? That depends entirely on exactly how risky it really is. 

Relative risk is a very poor way of judging risks and rewards. You're much more likely to die from bee stings than shark attacks. Does that mean you should take a swim in the ocean instead of walking through a field of poppies near the shore?

People *suck* at understanding probabilities, and particularly conditional probabilities. If you don't have information the victim doesn't have, you're not helping by adding your uninformed opinion to theirs.

All you're doing is blaming the victim.</data>

      <data key="d0">There is also nothing wrong with implying causal fault *if* the person truly did act recklessly.  People confuse this with the fact that people try to assign causal fault when the person really *wasn't* doing anything particularly reckless and use that to conclude that you should never blame a victim for anything.  That is very clearly not true.

Let's go for the case of climbing in the lion cage at the zoo with pocketfulls of raw hamburger.  To somehow try to say that the person cannot be blamed for their recklessness simply because they are a victim of a lion mauling would be absurd.  Again, it's a question of if their behavior truly *was* extremely reckless that matters, not merely if something bad happened to them.

How so? 

One of the person present was under the protection of something called "service de protection des hautes personalités" (it has been renamed since but still same goal). That mean that there was a policemen armed and trained specifically to protect someone in danger of being targeted. 

It sadly didn't do them much good. Unless you bring the same kind of weapons and protections as them it's akin to bringing a knife to a gun fight. Charb, one of the victim, said concerning the threats he previously received "je préfère mourir debout que vivre à genoux" (I prefer to die rather than live on my knee) and I mostly rejoin it concerning the argument you are making, the cost of constantly living in fear and packing enough fire power to fight this kind of things (you would need to be incredibly level headed, trained and lucky to do it simply with a hand gun) simply isn't worth it.

The unfortunate circumstance is that if someone is lurking and waiting to mug someone, someone is going to get robbed. Conditional on this, all anyone can really do is minimize the chance that it's them getting mugged. In the end, mug-ees must have presented themselves as easy (a simple statement of reward of attempting to mug &amp;gt; risk of attempting to mug) targets (or in the example of walking though bad neighborhoods, presented themselves as targets at all).

Given this, how much to blame to put on the victim is not something I'm here to argue about, as \u\thearmchairskeptic has already presented this line of thought, but to say that the mugger is always the singular cause is simply not correct.</data>

What do you mean there are no clear rules for most crimes?  Are more women mugged when alone or with someone else?  Are they mugged in bad areas or in decent areas? 

Of course they are rules. I made it clear I'm not exactly sure what all of those rules/probabilities are.

&amp;gt;But, yes, if I don't lock my window I make it easier for myself to be burglarized, but I in no way caused it.

And once again, please do a little reading up on causation, because it is clearly not at all what you think it is.  Causation is NOT univariate.  Causation does not exist in a vacuum.  Causation is most likely probabilistic, and must take into account a state space and the dynamics of that state space.  

For something to happen, all of the pieces which caused it must be in place, otherwise that thing wouldn't happen.  If the universe doesn't exist, nothing happens, and nothing is caused.  Thus, the universe is at least partially a cause of every action that takes place, just as you locking your window is partially a cause of not being burgled.  It's not the whole cause, because events are never caused by one single thing.  </data>

Even if it's "1 in 20" (which I understand to be a pretty average estimate, though figures vary hugely of course), it's (probably) a bigger risk than you would like to run for the very small gain of being able to listen to music and zone out on your way home.

Of course, similar arguments apply to "a friend's house during a party": paying attention to your drinks, for instance, is always very low-cost but sometimes high-benefit. Similar arguments apply to a lot of things: a friend of mine had his bicycle stolen, which is a pretty big loss when weighed against the low-cost advice "don't leave it unguarded and unlocked in plain sight in a public area for long periods of time" that he failed to heed. My point is simply that, in any situation in which anyone makes any kind of choice, it's reasonable to ask the question "do the costs outweigh the benefits?".

You simply cannot deny that a victim's actions are *always* part of the causality chain, because that's what causality is; a different action would lead to a different course of events which may simply lead to a lack of the problematic interaction.

*Fault* is a very specific subset of causality, which I would say is a choice of action or inaction that is a proximate/direct cause to the event, in which intent or negligence is a major factor, and in which the person making the choice has a moral obligation to prevent or avoid a certain outcome.

I would say that, under that definition, "fault" essentially cannot apply to the victim, because they have no moral obligation to prevent their own victimhood. Cause, however, certainly always applies because it is objectively true that their actions lead them to be in the place and time where the crime occurs; in no way does it inherently suggest that the victim should know this ahead of time, *but* being aware of the possible factors at play can help a person make choices that prevent them from becoming a victim.</data>

In criminal law, it is defined as the actus reus (an action) from which the specific injury or other effect arose and is combined with mens rea (a state of mind) to comprise the elements of guilt. 

Causation is THE ACTION.   

Once again, we are not playing freshman metaphysics 101.  "Whoa, reality dude"  This is a real world conversation.

&amp;gt;Are they mugged in bad areas or in decent areas

What is a "bad" or "decent" area?  As I said, everyone I know who has been mugged in NYC has been on their way to work, and they have all been men, by the way.  

But I am glad you are implying that women shouldn't be able to walk alone?

OP notes prevention as a reason why understanding how victims become victims is useful. Go walking in the bad neighborhood, you'll likely be mugged. Don't walk in them, your chances dramatically decrease. 

&amp;gt;I honestly would have to question your motivations, and whether your real goal is to help the victim.

It's using practical sense to try to keep more victims from piling up, and keep the original victim from becoming a *repeat* victim. Why is that a bad thing?</data>

Oh, right, I forgot poor people are responsible for being assaulted if they live in a dangerous area! How the hell did you reach this conclusion? So, what, if Mary is trying to walk home one day and she gets attacked we should all tell her it's her fault for living there? She can hardly go anywhere else. What if she's a child who was born there? 

Also, why do you persist in believing that someone who is attacked just isn't taking any steps whatsoever to protect her own safety? What if Mary is carrying mace, but it doesn't help her? What if the mugger uses it against her? Is she still "responsible" for her attack, or does she get a pass for trying to defend herself -- even if she gets hurt worse for it?</data>

      <data key="d0">First off, I don't think that this:

&amp;gt;"Well why was she walking through that street at night? That's stupid, she should have known she would get mugged."

is an accurate representation of what OP is saying at all. In fact, I think s/he made it pretty clear that s/he was against that type of response, as it is clearly unproductive and inappropriate.

Secondly, I don't think that this response:

&amp;gt;"Well, that's unfortunate. That's a really unsafe area. The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area."

actually addresses the issue we're discussing. IMO, OP's point was more that while we should not simply blame the victim and leave it at that, everyone should reasonably be expected to be aware of the potentially risky situations that exist in the world, and take some personal responsibility for their own safety in the face of an unjust world. To draw an absurd example, if I'm walking home from work one night and get mugged, that's not my fault. But if I'm getting mugged on the same block every night and I keep walking home that way without taking any extra security precautions to avoid a dangerous situation that I am fully aware of, it is unreasonably idealistic and naive to say that I am still in no way responsible for the outcome of those actions. One could even extend the example further: if I knowingly go walking through a well-known shitty ghetto full of crackheads and murderers at 4 a.m. wearing a jacket made out of $100 bills and I get robbed, is that in no way my own responsibility? Of course the act of the crime is purely the fault of the criminal, but at the same time it is my individual responsibility to look out for my own safety, in the knowledge that shitty people often do shitty things.

I agree that it's a very fine line to walk between the ideas of victim blaming and personal responsibility, and I'll be the first to admit that I don't know exactly where that line should be drawn, but I absolutely agree with OP in that this is a conversation that needs to be had in the general public.</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt; Sure, but then you're explicitly saying that explaining causation is "victim blaming"

No I'm not.  I'm saying that even when you *are* engaging in causal victim blaming, when the recklessness was high enough, it can be justified.  That's not to say that you have to do that every time you talk about causation though.  I was taking it one step further than even the OP, but I didn't disagree with the OP.

&amp;gt; The vast, vast, majority of times when someone calls "explaining causation" "victim blaming" are, in fact, unjustified and unwarranted victim blaming. 

I don't know if this is true or not, and you don't either.  I think you're just conveniently only paying attention to the times where it clearly isn't justified and ignoring the times where it is to draw this conclusion.  For example, how many times do drunk drivers damage their cars or themselves?  People will invariably say they are to blame for what they did, and the same goes for other similar actions.  You have no statistics as to how often that occurs vs how often people fallaciously blame rape victims, so you can make no claims about "the vast majority" either way.

&amp;gt; You really won't very often hear someone say it's "victim blaming" if you tell a person who fell while balancing on the wall of the Grand Canyon that he was an idiot. 

Exactly.  Because, like I said, blaming victims isn't inappropriate.  It's blaming victims that aren't actually blameworthy that's inappropriate, which you are confusing with the broader statement.

&amp;gt; Among other things... they aren't really victims, because they weren't victimized. 

If you think the word "victim" requires there to be some external perpetrator, all I can tell you is that you're mistaken.

      <data key="d0">Causation is almost never univariate.  You're arguing that "blame" is the same as "causation", which it isn't.  

Blame is a social construct that we use to determine who, given the laws and norms of a society, broke those laws or norms and infringed on the rights of another.

Causation is a different concept.  A person (unfortunately) is partly the cause of their own mugging if they are engaging in an activity that will make someone else more likely to mug them.  

They are not to blame, from a social perspective, but they are certainly part of the cause.  Assume for simplicity muggers only mug women who are scantily dressed.  Then if you are a woman, you dress scantily, and you are mugged, your dress was part of the cause.  It wasn't the whole cause, and the real world tends to deal in probabilities rather than certainties, but the points remains the same.

It is your social (and lawful) right to dress that way, so you can't be blamed.  But if you had not dressed that way, you wouldn't have been mugged, so it's clearly a different story than you're acknowledging.

Every day we all do things which decrease the chances of bad things happening to us.  I lock my doors, even though it is illegal for someone to enter my house without permission.  When I drive, I not only follow the law, I make decisions in certain situations that make it more likely I'll be safe (decisions I'm not legally required to make).

I can't be blamed if someone steals all my shit if I don't lock my doors, but in a society of human beings, some of whom aren't so nice all the time, it's worth having discussions about how to act in private and public to reduce chances of harm coming to you.  

Black men are told to "talk white", pull their pants up, and not wear hoodies in order to not be seen as a threat.  Women are told to dress conservatively.  

While I think that both of these situations are royally fucked up, I also want people to be as safe as possible, and one way to be safer is to acknowledge the reality that walking through a really bad part of town with your headphones in is usually a bad idea, etc.

There are those fucked up people who think the onus is on the woman not to get mugged, and that's total bullshit.  But the fact that a woman may be able to make herself safer by engaging in certain actions/wearing certain things still may be true (I actually have no idea on that statistics here, I'm just arguing the idea of causation vs. blame abstractly), and if I were a woman, I would want to know that, and probably engage in the safer activities.  Or maybe I'm just a coward.

Edit:  I want to point out that bad things can happen to you even if you take ridiculous precautionary steps to stay safe.  But in a probabilistic world, all you can do is play the odds, and decreasing the odds of danger is usually seen as a positive. Some people prefer freedom to safety, and that is valid.  But there always have to be compromises until we have a perfect society.</data>

You say that *now*, but...

&amp;gt; it's assumed the aggressor is beyond good sense in the first place

Here, you have demoted 1) and 2) from "choices" to foregone conclusions. The aggressor has been re-framed as a deterministic causal agent, whose decisions are the outcome of some hard-to-map psychological processes, and yet the victim remains 'responsible' for 3) and 4), as the only decision-making agent left for consideration.

Getting drunk with strangers, particularly if you're of a physically weaker or more sexually sought-after gender or body type(Sorry mods!!!) is dangerous. Everyone knows this. No one is served by reminding anyone of it, *least of all* the vulnerable people doing it. They know. People do it anyway because it's fun.

&amp;gt; But we can help potential victims by advising them not to put themselves at needless risk

"Needless" is the problem word here. If we're going to get hardassed about how that word is defined, then we're back to the ol' "stay at home forever" scenario. But if you're willing to soften the definition of "need" such that it includes things like "i *need* to have a satisfying social, sexual and recreational life" then you have a where-to-draw-the-line problem. How much fun is enough? How much risk is too much? What's the best compromise to choose between safety and excitement?

Anyone presuming to answer that question on someone else's behalf, is making some very uncharitable presumptions about that person's ability to evaluate risk. They ought to make *damn* sure they're actually telling them something they don't already know, and the vast vast majority of people offering safety advice, aren't.

At the very least, such people are saying "You would be better off if you had X% less risk of being victimized and Y% fewer opportunities for spontaneous, free-wheeling fun in your life". But the optimal tradeoff ratio between X and Y is a completely personal, completely subjective question which depends on *what people want out of life*. Who am I to tell anyone that on their deathbed, they'll be happier to look back on a life in which they didn't get sexually assaulted, but never went anywhere unsafe?</data>

This is not the correct response at all because you completely fail to address the issue that Mary actually did make a risky decision by walking through that area or whatever.

It's not classism, it's statistics. With the exception of children, poor people are poor because of bad decision making, poor money management, impulse acting, and other problems that go along with those.

&amp;gt;Not.

Not? I'm pretty sure everything went fine. I miscounted the fact that the company was paying for the hotel, but I needed to charge it on my card. This was a risk-assessment failure on my part. But in the end, I managed to get things sorted out. If someone had told me this (or mentioned it after), I'd have known to prepare, and *know* to prepare for it next time. I know to be sure to check whether it's credit-card confirmed, whether the payment is going to me or if it's prepaid, etc.

&amp;gt;Everything went fine because you were lucky and the chance of being attacked is incredibly low, even in dangerous places.

But isn't (according to you) the reason people get attacked is because of dangerous people? You are contradicting yourself. I actually almost got scammed. But I used my brain, minimized risk, and turned down suspicious offers. Minimizing risk is the whole point.

&amp;gt;Do you think every single person who is attacked is just an idiot who isn't being cautious?

More or less. Either they didn't calculate the risks, or they lacked something in that calculation. Or perhaps they simply made a poor decision knowing the risk. Either way, they are either an idiot, or one who knew the risks and accepted them. Which is why informing them afterward is useful.

&amp;gt;Most people who are assaulted, raped, or murdered are victims of people they already know.

Yup, which reveals even *more* bad decision making. Why associate with people who would do that? Why keep yourself vulnerable to people who you don't know if they would do that or not? Sure, when you are younger, it makes sense to make these mistakes. I had a 'friend', who was great. But he ended up stealing from me. Looking back, it's obvious. He's a lier (which I knew, but was fine with), he came from a poor family, didn't clean up well, generally had a bad reputation,  etc. I should've known, but I didn't. Because I was a kid and wasn't told of this type of thing. I immediately broke off contact and was wary of similar individuals in the future.

In comparison, I had another poor friend, same type of situation, but he didn't steal at all, though I was careful about keeping an eye on him. He turned out to not be that great of a friend, but he was okay. I kept him at a distance.

People have too much trust, and not enough risk awareness.

&amp;gt;In many cases, people they have a reason to trust, like friends and close family.

Family can't be trusted. At least, mine can't. They've proven that to me time and time again. Friends I take on a case-by-case. Some friends I'd trust with my life. Others I wouldn't trust with the TV. Trusting people blindly is stupid. The friends I'd trust with my life have the same attitude towards me, and I've known them my entire life. I know how they think, I know how they behave, etc. I realize there's a risk of them backstabbing me, but that's incredibly low. Other friends I have a very low tolerance for, as I mentioned.

&amp;gt; But they aren't smart like you, so it's their fault. 

It's not about being smart. It's about risk-management.

&amp;gt;Similarly, if you'd been attacked, you'd be crying that it was unfair and not your fault, but you're quick to assume everyone else is a complete dumbfuck who doesn't know how to tie his shoes, much less protect his safety.

Nope, I've had a history of being stolen from when I was younger. When I was pretty much powerless (can't move due to parents) and stupid (being a little kid). Both are definitely fair. I simply assumed nothing could go wrong. And that was stupid. But I was a dumb kid who listened to everything the "feel good people" told me. Once I got my hands on the internet, the truth became clear, and I brought up my guard. Never had a problem after that.

&amp;gt;Sorry bud, you can't answer a "should we" question with yes and no. We either do it or we don't.

As I said, my moral response is yes and no. It's not entirely her fault. But her living there definitely is part of the cause. The straight objective answer is "yes", but that doesn't reflect my thoughts on the matter entirely. It's a simplification used to straw man my views. In a morally grey world, nothing is black and white. Is it okay to kill a fat man in order to save 10 thin people? Yes and no is the answer. It just depends.

&amp;gt; If you aren't sure about your morals in this situation, don't try to debate about it.

My views are very clear. But "should we all" is not part of them. I don't think everyone should do the same thing. I also don't think telling Mary is an obligation. I also don't think Mary is the entire reason it happened. So it's a straw man. I *must* say yes and no, it encapsulates some of my view, and other parts don't.

Yes, Mary was part of the cause. Yes, Mary could've prevented it by acting differently. Yes, it's a good idea to tell Mary what she could do to prevent future acts. No, it's not entirely Mary who caused the event. 

&amp;gt;Did your mother walk you home from the bus stop when you were 15? That would actually explain a lot.

Yes and no. Again, not a straight answer, because it can't be. Some days I caught a ride with my parents, other days I took the bus. I went to a small school my entire life. I knew the people who went on the bus. Actually though, at 15 I was in high school, so yes, since it's a far distance I got a ride with my Dad in the morning when he went to work.

But in general, what the fuck are you doing in an area that isn't safe alone when you are under 18? That's ignoring the risks, which is entirely what my point is. Both the parents being ignorant *and* the child. I *chose* to stay home when I was that age. Simply because I found it a better use of my time.

I also used that time to skip ahead a few years, take college classes, as well as work as a college tutor. Again, focusing on risk management and planning goals.

What would be stupid is to go hang out in bums park at that time. Again, why the fuck would I be there? Why would my parents *let me* go there? My parents have a low risk tolerance anyway, and are pretty cautious. I don't mind it, and actually have adopted a similar mindset because of it.

&amp;gt; No but seriously, most crimes occur in private places, so the crimes occurring in dark alleyways are what's minimal.

Definitely true.

&amp;gt;Your chance to be mugged is far, far lower than your chance not to be, no matter how dark the street.

I'd argue that your chance to be mugged is dependent on how much time you spend around muggers. I'd imagine muggers mug each other a lot. When you hang around criminals, you'll be involved in crimes. Makes sense.

&amp;gt;You are, in essence, accusing people of not forseeing something incredibly unlikely. 

Walking down dark alleys is a bad idea anyway, muggers or not. Can't see where you are going, could be wild animals (which happens, I've seen coyotes, raccoons, etc), can get lost, might have picketpockets or muggers, etc. Though it really depends on the area too. 

I'm not accusing people of anything. I'm saying to look at the risks, and figure out what's safest, if that matters to you.

&amp;gt; I might as well ask why you visit your family on the holidays, since there's a statistic chance they'll rape and murder you.

I typically don't. I also acknowledge that there's a good chance of domestic violence, rampant alcoholism and drinking, etc. I acknowledge these facts when I visit, and I visit typically because I enjoy (most of them anyway) their sober opinions on things. I don't typically like my Dad, but when he's sober he's pretty responsible, which I like. When he's drunk, I avoid him. My mom is chill mostly. Sober she's fun and has cool thoughts. Drunk she just complains a lot, nothing that bad. My siblings are fine. Most of them share a similar mindset than me, and if need be I can defend myself from them (haha).

Other family I don't visit at all. And if my immediate family visits them (and I tag along) I treat them as strangers, not family.

So yes, I'm well aware of the risks and if something were to happen, I acknowledge I made a bad move and it's partly my fault I got into it.

&amp;gt;Not all risks can be avoided. 

Right, but they can be minimized. Though most of the time, the victim didn't minimize anything.

&amp;gt;What if there's no alternative but to go down the dark street to get home?

This implies you passed the street originally. When leaving the house, be sure to follow lit streets. Easy.

&amp;gt;Where I live, there are miles and miles of land with no streelights, and neighborhoods with several blocks that have no light at all. 

Move to an area that does. Easy.

&amp;gt;Not everyone is so fortunate as to be able to get rides everywhere, particularly poor people who can't afford the gas.

I actually walk. I live in a well lit area, and one that is generally considered the safest city in the US. I chose it intentionally. The entire place is actually owned by one huge company, which the city is named after. So pretty much everything around is land owned by them, and there's security all over the place and well trusted workers. No problems.

&amp;gt;What if the mugger chooses Mary because a previous mark looked too intimidating?

My argument is on opportunistic crimes, not premeditated ones. Which is an entirely different story. If someone sees Mary in their yearbook, remembers her and wants to kill her. There's nothing Mary can do to minimize the risk. She *is* the target. The only thing to do would then be avoid her killer. Which she couldn't know about. In this case, you'd have a point.

My point (like OP) is to discuss rational and logical ways of minimizing risks that the victim could've done.

&amp;gt;if the mugger had no expenses, he wouldn't be out mugging people.

True, and this is what we should focus on, why the mugger committed the crime.</data>

Exactly. I think where the OP runs afoul is on the [Gricean Maxim of Relation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle). In most cases, bringing up causation is a non sequitur unless you're assigning blame. It doesn't really cut it to say, "well I'm just trying to explain that that part of town is unsafe" because there is no one to whom that fact can be more clear than the victim, who has just had a much more powerful object lesson in just how unsafe that part of town is. And anyone hearing the victim's story now understands it as well -- the person was in that part of town and something unsafe happened, people will put two and two together without somebody else explaining how it's unsafe.</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt;Exactly how do you define "fault"? Cause I'm pretty sure we don't agree on this word.

Deliberately creating an action that leads to an event. You bought a plane ticket, the plane then crashed. It is your fault you died in a plane crash. It is *not* your fault that the plane itself crashed. Just that you were on it.

&amp;gt;I am not trying to suggest that people have no responsibility for their own personal safety. 

This is commonly the reason people point out 'victim-blamers'. The point is that people have responsibility for their safety. And they are always at fault for their location and situation. Avoiding bad situations and going to good ones is entirely the responsibility of the person.

Is it their fault the crime occurred? No. But it's their fault they were the victim (provided that the crime would have occurred had another person been in that situation).

&amp;gt; But the reverse applies as well, shouldn't it? Sure, it's hard to get rid of that mugger. But we can do a lot to improve the situations around us.

Naturally. Though you might not be able to 'blame' the mugger. Perhaps it's a mental illness. We shouldn't punish that. We should get it fixed. If someone jumps off a building because they are depressed, is that their fault? Partly. They have a mental illness, and they didn't keep check on their mental health. No mental illness, and they wouldn't have done that. But they still chose to jump off the building.

So instead of throwing the person in jail or punishing them (or 'victim-blaming'), we should treat the problem itself, and reduce the chances of it happening. One way is to remove all the buildings. But that doesn't solve the problem, it just removes that particular instance. The root of the problem is the illness. Not the person or situation.

With the mugger, same thing. What's the reason they mugged? Try to fix that, rather than simply punish.

On the flip side, the victim should also be aware of how to avoid those situations. Regardless of whether or not they are the one who initiated the action (they might have been). Say they were taunting a drunk guy. It's their fault they got punched. Don't taunt drunk people and you won't get punched. Simple. But you can 'blame the victim/perp' by saying "when you are drunk you shouldn't punch people" and that the drunk guy is at fault.

Both are true. The victim initiated by causing an action in the perp. The perp then initiated the crime. If the victim didn't taunt the perp, the perp wouldn't have striked.

&amp;gt;Yes, I completely agree we should do things like warn others before they hit a dangerous street, or tell people to lock their doors, or other common-sense things.

This is the topic at hand. Discussing what both society and the victim did that caused the problem. Yet, this gets called 'victim-blaming'.

&amp;gt; I was targeting the conversations that happen afterwards.

The conversations afterwards should focus on how to prevent the problem in any way possible. For the victim, that means not doing the things that lead to that type of situation. Like, being sure to lock your door. You could cry 'victim-blaming' to that. But it's not. It's giving an objective rational explanation for something that lead to the problem.

"Fault" shouldn't even be part of the conversation, IMO.</data>

      <data key="d0">I think you're correct for the most part, but still believe I can change your view a bit due to adding an emotional component you may not be considering due to inexperience with some situations. I want to note I don't think this inexperience makes you a bad person or an idiot, it's just data you may not have to put into consideration. While speaking about causation can be beneficial in a vacuum, there is an overall context that may make it harmful, and when and how you discuss it can lead to it being potentially more damaging than helpful.

When I entered my friend's room after they called me about being assaulted, I found them sobbing and repeating to themself "I'm so stupid." They had invited someone they didn't know very well into their room - something just about everyone I've known has done multiple times - and, in this case, it turned out for the worst.

If someone had come in and said to my friend, "well, inviting someone into your room is a risky thing to do," then I wouldn't be frustrated with that person because they were wrong, I would be frustrated with them because they were being emotionally inconsiderate. Yes, there were logical decisions on my friend's part that put them at risk, but my friend is already dealing with emotionally damaging self-blaming and self-loathing, and this just throws fuel on the fire. When someone is unable to leave a room for 3 weeks because of waking up in the middle of the night sobbing and having flashbacks, you pointing out how they could have lessened their chance of this occurring is not on the top of the list of things that need to be addressed. Later, when that person is speaking with a trusted therapist who can unwind causality from self-blame, is a more appropriate context to discuss the the issue with that person.

I'd equate it to walking up to someone whose dog was hit by a car and saying, "dog-chains will keep the dog away from the street and make it less likely to be hit by a car." You're not logically wrong, but you're not really helping. By pointing out the causality to the owner - who is likely already blaming themself - you're likely hurting them more than your information is worth. In addition, you're not fully informed; for all you know, the owner's last dog strangled itself on its chain, and he just put in a fence that the new dog dug under. This is why there are commenters in this thread who are saying people are being unempathetic; they're not seeing the emotional context of the event, and just focusing on the logical context - considering the causality in a vacuum instead of as part of a whole incident. Again, this is not because they're stupid, but because they likely have never had a full context on an issue like this before.

This is not to say that conversations shouldn't be had about dangerous areas, or that people shouldn't be warned about dangerous activities; those things lead to better-informed citizens and better policing, as well as other endeavors such as improved lighting for areas that are high-crime. However, there needs to be a question of when and with whom that conversation should be had; in cases like sexual assualt, I think the causation argument should be had with the therapist. People who see it on the news and say it, especially without the full context, are potentially doing more damage to the person than they are helping, without realizing it.</data>

After they have been attacked there, then yes it is to me. It wouldn't matter where it is, how safe it is, or anything else. I wouldn't be returning there, at least not alone. Because exactly as you said, it is an emotional and I would say instinctual response. Whether or not it's dangerous to you or everyone else, it's now a dangerous spot for the victim.

Now, if for some reason you knew Mary and knew she planned to return there for some ungodly reason, then yes. Warn them. Just like you would warn anyone else. 

&amp;gt; certain forms of behaviour that may increase one's liklihood to be attacked (like paying for a drink in a sketchy bar by pulling out a thick money clip) will not necessarily lead to one becoming a victim.

When you get to items of causation that are this small, how do *you* even know these things?

Let's say there's a study saying men who carried fancy money clips got robbed 20% more often than other people. That would be basic unknown information. In comparison to my story of Mary, she didn't know the place was dangerous before, while she does know now. 

For both of these situations, you could discuss with each victim relevant scientific data that may assist them (after an appropriate amount of time for them to heal in my opinion) just as you would discuss it with anyone else. 'Hey did you hear about this study about money clips?' is a lot different than 'Hey money clips get you mugged.' Then they can make an educated decision about how to protect themselves. But no one has any proof that the money clip specifically caused the mugging. Is it a possibility? Sure. But so is this guy's gelled hair or nice coat or shiny belt or shiny shoes or car key. 

When you get to that point, where do you draw the line on what someone *should* know? Should we say no one should go to a bar unless they are dressed in sweats with no belongings on them and no makeup and messy hair to protect ourselves from crime?

At a certain point, things go beyond "reasonable" ways of protecting yourself and reasonable things to know. And sometimes those reasonable things extend to the larger things too - like Mary on a dark road when she's from out of town. It just depends on the situation. Every situation is different.</data>

      <data key="d0">I like to think of it as natural products can be found in nature in the form we use them regularly (without the need for a chemical transformation). If the only way the product is created is in a laboratory, factory or anything resulting from human activity than it could be called "unnatural", or synthetic/man-made if you want to avoid the negative connotation of unnatural. Even though all transformations from the raw material to the final product must follow natural laws, it does not mean that the transformations would ever occur naturally, without human intervention. Sure you can expand the definition of natural to include these man-made products, but if you were to do that, the word natural loses its ability to describe things and differentiate between things we find and use and things we have to chemically alter or create. If this were the case you would need to describe things as "not synthetically made" to gain an edge over man-made products that are marketed as natural.

I'll try to give an example without getting overly scientific but trans fats aren't natural, by this definition. To my knowledge trans fats rarely occur naturally, if ever. This is because when fats are formed, they arrange the elememts in a different orientation, known as cis. One way that the kther form, trans fats are formed is at high heats when the chemical bonds in the fat are broken and the alternative arrangement of bonds is formed in the trans arrangement. If i remeber correctly, one way trans fats are made is when oil is reused after frying. Obviously, no natural laws were broken when the trans fats were made so I guess you could call them natural. However this type of fat is never seen in nature, so when humans digest it, supposedly bad things happen. I think this is because it is in a form that our bodies have never seen before. For this reason I would argue that it's fair to call trans fats unnatural. If you want to change the word so it doesn't interfere with the idea that we are a part of nature call them man-made products or synthetic or something. But I feel as though in order to keep everyone informed about the food they are eating, and products they are buying, there has to be a distinction.

I don't feel like all synthetic products are bad, for example polyester and polymers have changed the world, and continue to do so. Especially the ones that combine different chemicals that are never combined naturally to get the most desirable charecteristics from each separate natural chemical. There are a ton of great man-made products like teflon and other coatings. They just don't occur naturally.

One more point is that the view that everything is natural is often used to market products, many of the "natural flavors" in food are created synthetically. Although I'm not completely sure if the chemicals they make are found in nature, many of them probably do. But this raises another question, does it matter how we obtain the chemicals, or just if they are observed in nature when we use the word natural?

&amp;gt;In much the same way, saying "you should stay in at night" or "you shouldn't dress like that" is equally not constructive.

You're cherry-picking two poor examples. Let's say that someone leaves their car parked in the ghetto, with the doors unlocked, the keys in the ignition, and the engine running. It *is* constructive to tell them that they should lock their doors and keep the keys in their pocket - *ideally* if you tell them this ahead of time, but it's still constructive to tell them after the fact if they don't seem to understand why it happened to them, or if their reaction to the crime is just "the thief shouldn't have stolen that" with no intention to change their own actions ("No, it shouldn't happen, but it does, so lock your doors and hang onto the keys").

&amp;gt;These discussions about cause need to focus on what needs to be changed. The behavior of the perpetrator needs to be changed, not the behavior of the victim in most cases.

No, it needs to be about both. Yes, we need to enact societal change that eliminates crime. But that's a long time off. In the meantime, we should be educating people on methods they can use to protect themselves, rather than twiddling their thumbs and complaining that preventable things "shouldn't have happened."</data>

Yup. But that's why people point out things. People generally know "shady streets are bad". But perhaps they don't know that X street is shady.

&amp;gt;If you have information that helps an uneducated person (or know them personally and just know they're an idiot I guess), yes I agree, completely share it regardless of what happened, who they are, or what the situation is. It is not victim blaming to discuss information. It would not be obvious that the street is only unsafe at 3pm. It is simply obvious that it is unsafe.

Yup, and this is the point I'm getting at. But this act is still called victim blaming by many people.

&amp;gt;The difference in conversation would simply be "You shouldn't have gone there" vs "At 3pm, there's a lot of bad kids getting out of school." Again my point - you've separated the victim from the discussion, and now the discussion is valuable.

Yup, the intention is the same, but one provides valuable and not well known information.

&amp;gt;My only caveat for discussing these things directly to the victim would be sensitivity to the healing process, but again that's probably a separate issue if it's not obvious.

Right. And some people just aren't good around sensitive and hurt people. Lots of people have a 'blunt' attitude to them (myself included) and don't realize people get offended by some (to us) obvious things that can/should/need to be pointed out.

Which is where the problem comes. Someone posts blunt advice, and then gets called out for victim blaming because everyone is an emotional train wreck and siding with the victim, rather than objectively looking at the event.</data>

In which case they've minimized their risk. Which is the point of the conversation. Naturally if they've taken all the precautions, there's no need to further discuss them. The point is to ensure that personal risk is minimized.

&amp;gt;People already know about bad neighborhoods. They choose to go into them anyway, be it convenience or necessity. Telling them "Don't you know not to go into bad neighborhoods?" after the fact is demeaning and unnecessary. 

True. But saying "X is a bad neighborhood, didn't you know?" is more specific. Perhaps they didn't know X street on a wednesday has a weekly shootout. And they might have avoided it had they known.

But yes "don't go to bad neighborhoods" by itself is pretty useless.

&amp;gt;They already regret their decision (because they were raped/mugged), and adding to that regret by assuming they're ignorant is a pretty shitty thing to do.

It's general advice. X-street has a lot of muggings. Yes, you got mugged there, which adds another data point. Though had I not told you this info, you might assume the mugging wasn't connected to X-street and continue to travel along there. Now you know it was because you walked along X-street, and can avoid it in the future.

You are assuming people have perfect knowledge. And in many cases they don't. At all. Which is why they got into the situation in the first place.

Either way, the overall point is to discuss *all* of the causes, and how to minimize them. Simply ignoring it because "you blame the victim" I think is more harmful to the situation.

On top of that, I'm not aware of what information you know. Like, did you know to avoid the streets by the lake in my community when night comes? You didn't, because you don't have knowledge of the area. It's also nice to inform you that coyotes travel around the outer edges. As you most likely didn't know that either.

Which is my point. It's not that I'm *blaming* you. It's that I'm giving you advice for the future. Which is definitely a beneficial act.</data>

Do you disagree that most popular victim blaming is regarding rape? You keep trying to make it out to be a fixation, when I gave you the reason.

&amp;gt; Nobody said that a person walking down a sidewalk is a cause for being hit by a car. Nowhere is that mentioned. At all.

I created the hypothetical situation to illustrate a point; of course nobody mentioned it. Had people already considered this situation, I would not have needed to create the hypothetical.

&amp;gt; That person is not a cause in your scenario.

I'm glad you got the point of the hypothetical. The person on the sidewalk is not a cause, even though their action (being present) was a minor contribution to what happened. This is just like how a person on the street isn't a cause for their mugging, even though they happened to be present at the same time as the mugger.

&amp;gt; The whole point of this topic is that causes should be examined to see what did and did not contribute. You keep making up scenarios just to point out things that are not a cause. 

And I'm explaining that these things happen irrespective of what the OP considers causes. Both locked and unlocked houses get robbed, and the vast majority of unlocked houses *don't* get robbed. To say not locking a door caused a robbery is simply wrong.</data>

Think of it this way.  I choose to stand on the corner of Elm St. with a gun to mug people.  Now by you walking down Elm St. you are the cause?  

If I tell you I am going to murder you if you don't leave the country, and you don't leave, you are part of the cause?

This is setting up a bizarre society in which criminals can push the blame on victims by saying, "they should have known what I was going to do."

Several generations of highly experienced professionals have been working on that and made some progress, but nowhere in the world have they succeeded.  Victims still often feel blamed and shamed after dealing with specially trained professionals, never mind their families and friends. 

Raped women usually pass up the chance of legal retribution and trying to protect others from the rapist because the personal cost is too high.


&amp;gt;  It is absolutely implausible to me that any rape victim would sincerely conflate the psychological pain of being raped with the pain of being respectfully questioned by people who are just trying to understand what happened.  

What is your assessment of plausibility or respectfulness worth? 
You not been raped.  (Why is that obvious, considering that men do get raped?)

Have a look at the science-based guides written by health professionals for dealing with rape victims, or a few of the many first-hand accounts of victims available online.

It is common for women to report that the original rape was just the first part of their ordeal, and the rest was supplied by well-intentioned people who didn't have a clue about dealing with a rape victim but decided to just pull ideas out of their ass instead of educating themselves before trying to interact.  
  
  
I've got a bee in my bonnet about rape because the subject comes up so depressingly often in suicide support.  I always thought I knew how bad it is, but like most men I didn't really get it.  
Did you notice my confident assumption you are male? That's how I knew.

Let's say Jean is at a bar. He/she sees s Sam at the bar and knows Sam likes to beat people up. Jean decides to go up and insult Sam. Sam punches Jean and knocks them out.

 When Jean comes back to their senses(which are already in question due to the decision to provoke someone unstable), is it reasonable for Jean to be surprised by the assault?

Now let's bring the scenario a step closer to reality. If Jean insulted Sam and Sam punched Jean, and when Jean went down, they knocked over the next person who spilled their drink on someone else which led to a brawl. Does Jean have any responsibility for what happened to the other people who were hurt in the brawl?</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt;Blaming the victim is counterproductive, because, as you say, someone was going to get mugged anyway.

Not necessarily. If every single person avoid the mugger, no crime could be committed. The point of giving advice to the victim is to ensure *they* don't fall into the same situation. It's a personal solution to a societal problem.

You argue with your in-laws? Don't visit them. Easy. That avoids the argument. Naturally the "solution" (not 'victim-blaming') would be to make them get along. But in the mean time, there's things you can do to reduce the situation of occurring *to you*.

&amp;gt;The thing we are trying to prevent is "mugging" not "going into that area that we perceive to be dangerous."

Mugging is opportunistic. The point is to get something from someone, particularly of value. In this case, if you remove those possibilities, the mugging can't and won't happen. Put a cop in sketchy areas. This prevents the problem. Avoid sketchy areas. Again, prevents the problem. Which one can the average person do?

As the average citizen, you can't fix 10,000 nameless unknown criminals. So you do your best to avoid situations where you'd run into them. It's a personal solution to a societal problem.

&amp;gt;I don't agree with the arguments you present as a rebuttal, and I doubt we will agree.

Honestly, I feel that 99% of problems comes from substance abuse. In a group of sober, non-addicted people, there's pretty much 0 problems. Look at an office or university. If you want to avoid problems, risk-assesment tells you should stick to those areas if you want to be safe.

As for what specifically leads up to rape/intrusions/muggings/etc, we aren't 100% sure. Which is why it's good to spread info on what does. So we can avoid those situations while the problematic people are apprehended and helped.

If someone's a loon, there's a good chance you should avoid them. As they aren't straight in the mind and might cause problems. If you go up anyway, and get mugged, that's your damn fault. You could've easily stayed away and didn't.

The point is we should examine all of the lead-ups, not just those on the part of the initiator.</data>

      <data key="d0">Yes, more or less.

Mary understands it's a dangerous area, and suggesting that she does not by informing her after the fact is condescending and accusatory. She knows it's unsafe. It'd be like telling me "hey that fire is hot" after I'm in the hospital with 3rd degree burns.

Here's my overall point as it seems to have gotten lost. Your subject is "Explaining causation is not victim blaming." My answer is that: "It completely depends on how you approach the subject." 

When people discuss causation, it usually includes victim blaming, as I described above, and that doing so completely invalidates the discussion and therefore the "worthwhile"-ness of the discussion. 

However, you are correct that it can be discussed it without victim blaming if done correctly and considerately, as I also described above. Though I would suggest that in human nature it is actually difficult to do (as you displayed by saying "I would tell Mary...").

      <data key="d0">OK, but what purpose does informing someone of their fault after the fact serve? And are you the right person to be doing that informing?

There are people who are trained to provide that information in more useful ways, and those same people are given access to the full facts of the case. 

I see no reason that some random dude on the street should have any reason to feel confident about his ability to assign fault to any party involved in a crime. And I DO think it can be very harmful when someone, ignorant of the facts of the situation, attempts to assign fault anyway.

To get a little more specific, many rape victims face this kind of fault assignment, where people ignorant of the full situation rapidly come to conclusions from incomplete information and then for some reason feel that it is appropriate to announce these conclusions loudly and publicly.

Essentially, I don't disagree that informing the victim of their unsafe behavior can be a good thing. I just think that in general, nobody but close friends, family, and investigators are really in a position to accurately assign fault in realistic situations, and therefore "explaining causation" is nearly never appropriate and is more likely to do harm than good when executed by a random stranger or acquaintance.</data>

      <data key="d0">Both these articles seem to be about victims of childhood sexual abuse being victims in adulthood as well. I think this is a completely different scenario. Being abused in childhood is going to affect you extremely on a mental level to make completely different sets of life choices, and yes I can see many of them would be destructive choices. 

In regards to abusive relationships as well - both of these things are typically very mental and usually long-term situations. They are going to completely affect you in every aspect of your life.

What I say only applies to a normal, mentally healthy person before the attack. I'm not qualified at all, and don't intend to present myself as an expert in abuse victims.

&amp;gt;If you do that, you're putting yourself at risk.

I think I need to edit my original post. I am not trying to suggest that we do not warn women about ways to protect themselves from being abused. My response was only concerning the discussion of the event after the fact, generally around people who are not directly involved with the victim. 

If you read an article or see on the news 'Young woman mugged on First Avenue' and all it says is that basic information, you're unqualified to judge or blame anything because you simply do not have the facts. You can discuss the situation ("oh that's a bad area") but you need to exclude the victim, because you do not have the ability to appropriately judge the situation. Victim blaming typically relies on assumptions ('oh she should have known that was a bad area'). Well, the article didn't tell you she's from another state.

I completely agree people need to educate and protect themselves. Asking someone to protect themselves is not victim blaming *because they are not a victim*. 

&amp;gt;"you did a stupid thing" without it meaning "you deserved to be sexually violated"

I have a problem with this because if you're in that situation, either one of two things has happened: *you know you did a stupid thing* or you didn't have the information at the time to make the correct choice. Everyone knows now that smoking causes cancer. Yes, I'm fine with telling someone who smokes today they are stupid. 30 years ago though, smoking was commonly known to be healthy. What good does calling those people stupid do?

If people don't know, educate them.

If people do know, give them a break. We're human. We fuck up. Rubbing it in does no good for anyone.</data>

      <data key="d0">As someone said before, your entire argument is based on the idea that one has control over the variables related to a crime. If you're in the wrong part of town, go to the right part of town. If a certain place creates poor achievers, move to the places that procure high achievers. If a third of the women in the military get raped, don't go into the military. 

This creates two problems. 
1.  Many people don't have the options you suggest. They may live in a shit part of town and not have the funds to move. In southern states it gets very hot, and so not showing skin for the sake of safety or security is extremely uncomfortable. Many people who get assaulted are very attractive and get harassed or groped even when taking precautions to downplay their good looks. Many don't have the expendable cash to avoid risky jobs or environments. These variables seem obvious to you and if one had the choice, they should choose the safest alternative. Most people choose the safest option they have, and often their safest option is still not the "good part of town" and would warrant the warning you suggest. 


2. Pushing back against criminal activity is significantly more effective on crime as a whole than taking a safer route. Adding lights, police officers, carrying weapons, etc is much more effective at deterring future crime than suggesting the safest route. When you advise one person to take a safer route, you don't stop the crime as much as deflect the crime to the next guy. This may work to help the individual, but as a community putting your efforts into lowering crime rather than encouraging the individual to avoid criminally active areas makes your community a better place. </data>

But that's not the same thing. Natural/unnatural is categorizing something. 'Human' basically is just a word that summarizes a certain combination of cells. You would need a definition of natural but there's really no good definition. e.g. for natural: 'existing in or derived from nature; not made or caused by humankind.' =&amp;gt; that would mean that humans aren't natural, which implies that a god or aliens or something created us. It rejects evolution.
'in accordance with the nature of, or circumstances surrounding, someone or something' =&amp;gt; that makes no sense either, who defines what 'in accordance with nature' is?

&amp;gt; If you exclusively use your definition for natural, then is anything unnatural?

As I said, it implies an external influence, like god or aliens or something. Most people just use 'unnatural' as a synonym for 'something I disagree with' often in relation to a behavior that is bad for nature (e.g. 'destroying the rain forest is unnatural' but it isn't, it's probably a bad thing for several reasons but humans are selfish because that's the way evolution made us, so it's not unnatural, it's actually very natural).

Both were the cause. Why do you assume there's only one cause? That's a naive view. Had someone else walked in, instead of him, that person would be mugged instead. Which means that the original crime was avoided. If no one walked in, no one would be mugged.

Which means that one of the causes is *definitely* the person who walks in. No matter how you look at it. No second person, no crime.

The inflictor is definitely the one to 'blame', however. As we wouldn't want to throw random people into jail simply for being a part of a mugging.

Either way, both the inflictor and victim were the cause. Just as the guy who sold the inflictor a knife/gun was the cause.

&amp;gt;A great example of that problem is when the cause of a rape is correlated with what the victim was wearing. First, culturally, the rapist is to blame, just like the mugger above, regardless of mitigating circumstances.

Correct. The rapist is the inflictor in this case. Had they not been there, the rape would not have occurred (or done by someone else). That said, the victim can certainly do things to lower the chance that someone will rape them. Such as not become drunk in a bar. Certainly that would drastically reduce the chance they'd get raped.

Though honestly, I don't think clothes have much to do with it. But being situationally aware certainly does.

&amp;gt; But second, there isn't actually a correlation between the chances a person will get raped and the clothes they are wearing. People erroneously think that there is a correlation because it "makes sense" and they fall victim to confirmation bias.

Well you have to understand why the inflictor is doing such things. Just like the mugger. They aren't doing it to 'be a mugger'. The mugger most likely needs money. So he mugs people for it. Don't have anything on you, and the mugger won't/can't take anything. Results muted. The rapist (from what I understand) wants sexually related power. It's not so much the clothes. In this case, avoid drinks from strangers, be sure to stay mostly sober. And don't uncautiously enter unfamiliar bars.

The victim is the victim because of their choices. And the victim is half the reason the crime is able to take place.

Edit: It's not like the mugger has it out for OP and will hunt him down. He just mugged the first guy he ran across. Which means OP can definitely make sure it's not him.</data>

Of course it's the mugger's fault the person got mugged. In a perfect world, that's all that matters, and muggings would never happen.

We do *not* however, live in a perfect world. The world is an ugly place with rapists and muggers and murderers and other assholes living alongside everyone else. Knowing this previous fact, and refusing to take precautions to better secure your own safety is foolish. 

In the previous example, nobody is saying that it was the muggee's *fault*, but they are saying that with foreknowledge of the relative safety of the route, he should have taken the safer route. He's not at fault for the mugging, but he still acted foolishly and could have prevented the mugging if he had not done so.</data>

If you kill a bunch of people in a public pool because your job was to manage the chlorine amount (and messed up) that's not your fault, but you were the cause of their death. As such, you shouldn't be punished unless you deliberately knew that it was a lethal amount.

That's the difference. While you are still the cause of the event, one was your fault and the other wasn't. If you are at fault, you should be punished. If not, simply instructed to pay more attention, and be sure to double check the chlorine amount.</data>

My mother works in a bad part of town and is required to go in before sunrise most mornings. On two separate occasions she has been approached by people meaning to do her harm. If she were not allowed to have her gun on her, I do not even want to think about what might have happened to her. On both occasions, she never even had to take the safety off. Just knowing a gun was present was enough to make the bad men go away. Most people who intend to do crime are lazy and aren't going to mess with someone who has a gun. They are going to go for the easy targets. Like gun-ban zones. I understand that there are crazy people who might just shoot up anywhere. But even a semi-rational criminal is more likely to go do crime where there is a much less likely-hood that they will be shot.

I have taken all of the courses to legally carry my gun in my state. I also practice quite a bit with it and am quiet proficient. I have spoken and shot with many police officers in my area and I am as good, if not better, than they are with our respective weapons. Most people I know that carry their guns regularly are the same as me. We practice, we know what we are doing. I can't speak for everyone of course, I am simply stating what I have seen. The world is getting crazy and I love the fact that I live somewhere where if someone looking to kill comes into a [chocolate shop](https://gma.yahoo.com/sydney-hostage-situation-5-people-flee-lindt-chocolate-060736501--abc-news-topstories.html) or news-paper building, I can at least attempt to defend myself with [something better than scissors.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhJjkUOmXH0)</data>

Like, say I never lock my front door and someone robs my home. You're right, the robber is the *cause* of the robbery. But by leaving my door unlocked, I increased my risk of a home invasion. Adults choose which risks they are willing to accept and which they are not. Maybe I live in a low-crime area, and the convenience of not having to carry a key makes leaving the door unlocked an acceptable risk (my parents never locked the door when I was a kid). Maybe if I am leaving the door unlocked and I get robbed, I will reassess my risk calculus and make a different choice - or maybe it will STILL be an acceptable risk.

It's technically possible not to do this. But it's extremely rare, and when you do, you really have to do a thorough job of it, or it ends up being counterproductive. 

Therefore, in general, I have to disagree with OP that "it's a worthwhile endeavor", particularly when the explanation is given to the victim rather than society at large, because the victim most likely already has an inflated view of the risks of the situation. 

In the vast majority of cases, someone "explaining causation" has far too little information to actually explain causation, such an explanation is almost entirely trivial, and the causation in any particular instance has very little to do with either the victim's situation or the overall societal problem. 

If you're really going to expend the effort necessary to do this correctly, I honestly would have to question your motivations, and whether your real goal is to help the victim. </data>

I enjoyed your post and agree with most of the details, though I tend towards the opposing position with the greater issue, but I think this example represents one of the main criticisms of the overall argument.

Many car accidents (perhaps even most) are effectively unavoidable by at least one party. This I think we agree on. However, a significant number are mutual to some degree, or in part aided by poor decisions and/or driving ability on the part of the accepted victim. That they are not deemed at fault for the collision doesn't change that.

In my admittedly limited experience, very few people are both skilled drivers and consistent practitioners of defensive driving. How many people consistently scan all of their mirrors, especially when stopped, or maintain both a safe speed and adequate following distance? Never look away from the road in front for more than 2-3 seconds at a time? Leave a gap when pulling up to an intersection to aid in escaping being rear-ended? Scan every intersection before entering? Attempt to maintain a staggered formation when driving on the highway? Never drive when fatigued, unwell, or otherwise unable to focus fully on the road?

&amp;gt;Most of the time they're aware of the risk, and they have been forced into a dilemma of choosing some compromise between freedom and safety when they were supposed to have both.

I think one of the more crucial points of debate is whether or not their framing and evaluation of that decision is relevant or a valid target for criticism. I agree that many, even most cases are reflexive or ideologically motivated and can be fairly described as victim blaming, but the current trend is very much to tar *any* questioning of a victim's decisions with that brush. It may be good for the victim (I don't think it invariably is, but that's another debate) but it does a serious disservice to their agency.</data>

&amp;gt; In your car example, there's not enough information to say which of those entities contributed, and you are focusing entirely on the people involved.

It was a simple example to demonstrate how you can attribute cause to a ridiculous extent. If an animal ran in front of a car, and caused the driver to hop on the sidewalk and kill a pedestrian; the cause is with the animal and the driver. The driver directly reacted to the animal, and the driver directed the car onto the sidewalk. To suggest the pedestrian should have avoided the sidewalk is unreasonable. Though avoiding sidewalks would have saved a life, it doesn't mean the pedestrian caused the accident in any way.

Likewise, saying you should dress conservatively, lock your house, and stay in at night is unreasonable. </data>

Overall most probably dont do much good, and some contain toxic compounds which in small amounts consumed or rubbed on skin(serious issue actually) would be fine, but the essential oils make it easier to reach certain levels that may be toxic in the long term.

&amp;gt;When something bad happens, there will always, always always be someone around to say "well you could have made yourself 5% less likely to be targeted by doing X", and the only way to not receive this kind of useless advice from someone, would be to stay home all day every day

That's taking things to an illogical extreme. When people try to determine causes of an event, they're not saying "you should just never do anything." They're singling out pointlessly risky behavior - like jaywalking in a busy street, or walking through a bad area, or getting drunk with strangers. Those things don't have much of a chance of making your life better, but *do* have a big chance of making it much worse (or ending it).

&amp;gt;The more meaningful question to ask, is "whose behaviour can be changed, and how, in order to optimize expected outcomes?"

This *is* what people are doing, when they look for causality. They want to understand why this thing happened, so that victims don't pile up. Usually when a crime is committed, it's assumed the aggressor is beyond good sense in the first place. Otherwise they wouldn't likely be committing crimes. But we *can* help potential victims by advising them not to put themselves at needless risk. The aggressor is assumed to be beyond reason, but potential victims aren't - they might take good advice and avoid harm.</data>

      <data key="d0">This is an anecdote, which is specifically not what you asked for. But it's not a pro-essential-oil testimony, so maybe you will find it interesting.

I used to go for regular massages with a group of friends. Just basic back massages using oil, with some essential oils added for "relaxation". The first time we went, I felt extremely nauseous and dizzy afterwards and had to sit down for 20-30 minutes till it passed off. Eventually we worked out it was the essential oils - if I got a massage with just carrier oil (almond?) I was fine; if she added essential oils I was sick.

I wouldn't expect something so negative to be a placebo effect (I had either neutral or mildly positive expectations for essential oils). And the effect seemed repeatable and strong. So, I wouldn't say I've found essential oils to be helpful for anything (except making me feel sick) but on the principle that if a drug has a real effect on the body then it should also be able to have side-effects - something natural medicine enthusiasts seem to often ignore - I suppose this has made me more open to the possibility that they have genuine physiological effects.

Probably worth pointing out though that none of my friends had this reaction!

From an actual scientific evidence point of view there are at least a few cases where there are real studies to support e.g. tea tree oil having antiseptic properties, but maybe these cases are exceptions.</data>

      <data key="d0">The ice example is different from the mugging example. The ice example would be more akin to "If both parents forget to feed a baby and the baby dies, it is both of their faults. If either had fed the baby, it would have lived." Both parents had a responsibility to feed the child and knew it would die if they did not. Both are complicit in the same crime, so the blame can be shared between them.

If I walk down a dark street I am not committing a crime, but the man who chooses to mug me is committing a crime. I have no responsibility to myself or to society to walk on only safe streets, and I do not know for certain that anything bad will happen to me if I walk down a dark street. The man who mugs me has a responsibility to society not to mug others. He knows they will be harmed if he does so. So he is both aware of the consequences of his crime and he is aware of his responsibility to avoid it. By ignoring both, he is to blame. I, on the other hand, am neither aware I am to be mugged for walking on the street, nor am I responsible for not doing so. So you can't say I have any share in the blame for my attack.

You're mixing up scientific causation with legal and social causation. By your reasoning, we might also hold the gun manufacturer responsible for the mugger, since he wouldn't have a gun if they didn't make it. Or we might hold my boss responsible at work, since I wouldn't be walking home if I didn't have a job. Legally, however, none of those make sense, and the same can be said socially. </data>

      <data key="d0">I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:
1) Explaining causation is not "blaming" the victim.
2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.

I'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 – I’m not certain that it’s a worthwhile endeavor.)

Let me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I’ve noticed – particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well – to blame the victims of terrible situations. We’re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn’t have been so drunk, or you shouldn’t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don’t deserve it. We like to think of our world as “just” in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people “Deserved” what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman “deserved” to be raped, but there’s a certain amount of “otherization” and lack of empathy that goes on – a sense that “well, that wouldn’t have happened to me, because I would’ve been more careful”. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that’s all bad.

On the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism – overt or structural – and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I’m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur – A and B – and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I’m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that’s not the view I’m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)

The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.

Thus, explaining causation is not justification. It’s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.

Finally, my second view is that it’s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we’ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they’re not, so we don’t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior – but it’s worth it to us, so that we don’t get mugged. 

I understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there’s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.

EDIT: Fixed a sentence.


EDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a "worthwhile endeavor" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and "explaining causation" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. 

As far as "part 1" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term "causation" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that "avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that "explaining causation is not victim blaming", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think "explaining causation" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. 

At any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.

Say a person is walking home and has a choice of two routes: one which is usually safe and one which is not. If the person getting mugged has knowledge of both routes beforehand and they choose the unsafe route, and get mugged, that person's action was an indirect cause and therefore cannot be discounted.


&amp;gt;If I throw a stone at a window, I am the cause of the window breaking, not the window for being there.

The context of this example is not relevant to the current discussion, which involves people as the victims and perpetrators. Is a person at fault for being hit by a meteor? Of course not. But nobody would blame the victim in that situation, and the OP was about victim blaming.

      <data key="d0">One of my hobbies is teaching self-defense. With several years in the military and about a decade of martial arts training it is still my psychology degree that serves the most good in these classes. 

See, in your example, Mary really shouldn't have been walking alone in that unsafe area. Mary has a responsibility to herself to be aware of risky behaviors and minimize them. There are always alternative options prior to a crime being committed except in extremely rare cases. 

Criminals are very risk averse individuals, by and large. They don't want to go to jail. They aren't going to take overt risks when they don't have to do so. So they look for people who are easily victimized. 

In general, when someone becomes a victim of these types of crimes, they have made several basic mistakes when it comes to personal self defense. 

Now, this isn't to say that the person is at fault. The criminal always is the only person to blame for choosing to commit a crime. However, by making bad choices, the victims create the conditional situation by which they can be made a particular victim. 

We live in a world where  rapes, muggings and other violent crimes happen with a certain rate. That is not something we can do much about. But we can drastically alter what our individual risk is, and in many cases lower it to near zero, by simply educating ourselves about proper self-defense measures and taking them vigilantly. 

It is not victim blaming to tell someone "if you do x then y becomes a much more likely result." </data>

I'm sure with the right culture it would, but maintaining a culture is hard. Like I said the role of these people would be to defend themselves and those around them. It wouldn't help deterring suicide attacks, and would most probably cause few more deaths from mistakes and irresponsibility, with a danger of this worsening. In cases of mass shootings like you outlined, which are the situations I am thinking of, it would perhaps be best that these people wouldn't be armed with a gun but a paralyzer (taser), so when they find a safe hiding place or cover they have a chance getting themselves in a position where they can use the paralyzer on the attacker. This would have most of the benefits as with what I imagined with guns except it might be less probable to work against well prepared attackers (against heavy clothing), but on the other hand it could also deter from suicide attacks as they usually count on not being caught alive and of course it always is best for the attacker to be brought to justice in court.

Except for the fact that it's really not. While you may think that muggers will be in shady neighborhoods, if everyone but other muggers avoids a place, very quickly muggers are going to change their MO. Someone else earlier mentioned that it is unlikely you will get mugged in times square, however, pickpocketing is rampant there and yet thousands of tourists walk through it every day.

Something happens to Mary. Mary gets mugged. You response is: "Well why was she walking through that street at night? That's stupid, she should have known she would get mugged."

The correct response is: "Well, that's unfortunate. That's a really unsafe area. The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area."

Do you see the difference? One is victim blaming. The other is having a mature discussion regarding the crime. It begins a helpful discussion on the realities of the situation and ways to improve the situation. It acknowledges your point - that there are dangers in the world that people can work to avoid - without dismissing the actual crime down to the victim's decisions. 

The first just says it's all Mary's fault. 

It's a massive difference. The first one should never be discussed outside of the victim, the police, and family. What if Mary was from out of town and didn't know the area was unsafe? What if Mary got lost? What if Mary got in a fight with her boyfriend and was kicked out of the car there? Are all of these not perfectly understandable reasons why Mary would be at that specific location at that time of night? How are you in any specific way able to judge the situation and draw those particular conclusions?

Does the second response not completely cover both your requirements? Explaining the causation of the crime and helping people through doing so (worthwhile)? Does it not do both of those *in a better way*?

It's *assumed* that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response. You hit the nail on the head here, you just miss the connection between the two. 

The world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. By saying things like "she shouldn't have been there" we are exactly saying "This would never happen to me because I would never do that" and therefore make yourself feel better by justifying the issue and therefore the world.

When we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don't talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don't talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was.

EDIT:

Things got confusing here I think, so I want to clarify a couple things.

#1. The point of all these examples was this: "Causation" can be discussed with or without victim blaming, and doing it with victim blaming does no one any good. These discussions typically do include victim blaming because it's human nature to victim blame, and discussing the topic without victim blaming is actually challenging. 

#2. How does this relate to OP's topic: Discussing causation is completely unrelated to victims at all. If you are discussing a specific victim, you're probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you're discussing the situation that happened, you're discussing causation. 

#3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It's perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It's not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house.

#4. I wasn't trying to ignite a discussion on when we should or should not victim blame or where lines of personality responsibility are drawn and I don't feel like that thread is relevant to the topic. I was discussing only the conversation that occurs after there has been a crime.</data>

I think you're being very generous with the term "meta-assessment". I maintain that people generally don't *think* about most things they do, and by that I mean both "don't consciously think about them" and "don't make the conscious decision not to think about them" (and so on). They act on complete autopilot. The advice "don't wear your headphones" or "stay vigilant when walking through parks" or even just "be careful at night" is, of course, an attempt to sway the listener's assessment of the situation, and I agree with you that that is unreasonable; but it also serves to plant the idea in the listener's head of making the initial risk assessment (or even the meta-assessment), something that might not have even *occurred* to them, and that I think is a valid and useful thing to do.

&amp;gt; making such a meta-assessment on someone else's behalf has the same inherent problems as making a first-order risk assessment

I wont go into gun problems but rather define USA's basic laws and their impact on stopping situations like the one in Paris today.

As a person living in a country with the right to bear arms, in my experience, when an incident  like this occurs there aren't many armed civilians nearby to assist. Many large cities ban concealed firearms regardless of our liberty to own weapons. Most work places ban guns from being on the premise.

Recently there was the [2011 Tucson Shooting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Tucson_shooting). I lived right down the road from where it occurred and was involved with police and media due to the relationship of the shooter and the high school he attended. It was a wild minute as the shooter unloaded 33 rounds into the crowd. When he stopped to reload he was assaulted by a bystander with a chair.

That was in the state of Arizona which is as far conservative and gun toting as it can get. I know many people who pack as if its the wild west. However, these people never seem to be armed at the time of need.

The right to bear arms is simply gun ownership. In the event of civil war between the people and the government, the people are able to fight back. Where you are able to carry your gun is situational.

[University of Texas Shooting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Whitman) was far more situational that would align with the OP's train of thought. A very long drawn out fire fight where police weren't equipped to deal with the gunmen. Citizens with hunting rifles fought back and kept the gunman pinned down as police entered the tower. This situation and a few others was the early starts of creating swat teams able to respond to armed gunman.

France has gun laws allowing citizens to purchase hunting rifles with permits. In the event of something like that happening in the suburbs of France, citizens could respond. 

However, the situation is so unlikely to occur as shooters rarely take to a single place and shoot from in for such a long period of time. Most shootings happen in an instant and even armed citizens aren't aware of the situation as it is occurring. Police officers and hired guards are constantly in mental preparation of responding to such a situation and know they are expected to take deadly force when they see a lethal situation occurring. If I'm carry my gun all the time but I'm simply going to a super market to pick up groceries I will be reluctant to shoot till I've assessed what is occurring.

Allowing concealed fire arms in a city like Paris to stop the threat of terrorists is a fruitless endeavor.</data>

This is a good point, and it's been mentioned elsewhere (I intend to give the Delta elsewhere as well - I've never awarded oen before, so hopefully this works). This changes my view slightly about the latter part of my general view - "it's a worthwhile endeavor". There are certain situations, of course, when "explaining causation" simply demonstrates a lack of empathy - and it's those situations that demand the most care and empathy in the first place. I was probably speaking a little too broadly in my original post, because that's definitely something I agree with, but I think you deserve a Delta for a well-reasoned and rational argument that's driven not just from logic but from a sense of compassion.</data>

You probably shouldn't feel too comfortable.

In many states... I want to say most but that may not quite be accurate... there's no prohibition of carrying in most places (and, if memory serves, all states in the union now allow carry, though some so restrictive that they may as well not).  Schools, yes, banned in most places... but movie theaters?  Restaurants?  Malls?  The doctors' office?  For the most part, those of us that carry can and do carry in all those places every single day.

For example, in my state, there's no prohibition on those places.  What we do have is a situation where if a theater manager, as an example, sees me carrying... well, firstly it means I didn't do *my* job right because I carry *concealed* so if I'm made I blew it... but secondly, all that can happen is he can ask me to leave.  And being a law-abiding citizen, I will without incident because otherwise the police can be called and I'd be subject to criminal trespass charges.  What about signs that are posted saying no guns?  They carry no "force of law" here, which means while I can be asked to leave and definitely should, the law says I can be there with my gun.  This isn't an unusual setup, it's true in many states (again, it may even be most at this point).

The thing is, unless you live in one of the very anti-gun states (the NY, CA, NJ, CT, MA, MD's of the world) you've most likely been around people with guns many times and didn't even know it.  And notice you're still alive none the less! :)  Whether that (not you being alive, the other thing) makes you uncomfortable or not is up to you.  Personally, I *like* knowing others around me value their lives enough to defend them if the need arises.  People who willingly giving up their right to self-defense tend to be much more dangerous on the whole.</data>

I completely agree with everything you've said, but here's the catch. When I suggest the person "has at least an ounce of common sense", I am speaking about things which are obvious. Is everything in the world obvious? Absolutely not. Someone pointed out to me - does everyone have common sense? Absolutely not.

If you have information that helps an uneducated person (or know them personally and just know they're an idiot I guess), yes I agree, completely share it regardless of what happened, who they are, or what the situation is. It is not victim blaming to discuss information. It would not be obvious that the street is only unsafe at 3pm. It is simply obvious that it is unsafe. 

The difference in conversation would simply be "You shouldn't have gone there" vs "At 3pm, there's a lot of bad kids getting out of school." Again my point - you've separated the victim from the discussion, and now the discussion is valuable.

My only caveat for discussing these things directly to the victim would be sensitivity to the healing process, but again that's probably a separate issue if it's not obvious.</data>

We can definitely talk about causation though, but let's really look at the causation of these things. Mental health, education, poverty - these are the best starting points. And for so many more things than just rape.

Arguing about whether or not a person should be in an area is pointless.

Indeed, so it isn't such an easy word to define I suppose.

&amp;gt; I don't follow either. What are subatomic particles doing or not? What 'outside agent'?

Subatomic particles are interacting with each other, unconsciously (as far as we can tell, anyway). Humans consciously do things.

They are the outside agent I am talking about, they do things purposefully as opposed to just because gravity brought them together or the strong nuclear force keeps them close or whatever.

&amp;gt; How can humans be natural but not their behavior? E.g. humans are social because there were evolutionary advantages to this, also humans are violent because there were evolutionary advantages to this.

Who said human behavior was unnatural? The things produced by humans fall pretty solidly under commonly accepted definitions of the word unnatural. Their behavior is perhaps a bit of a grey area.

&amp;gt; No, the MacBook is natural too when you think it through. That's the same as e.g. an animal digging a hole. We're just sophisticated animals, so we produce sophisticated tools, that's all. I know people don't call MacBooks natural, but in fact they are.

Yes, everything within the universe is natural. But the point of words is to express nuance. Some people have a reason to differentiate between things like rocks and things like ruins. My point is that if you're going to simply lump everything into the natural category and eschew the unnatural one then you could frankly just simplify everything in this way. "Look at that collection of subatomic particles interacting with that other collection of subatomic particles!"

Words have subjective meanings, not objective ones. There are no words just floating out in space that tell humans how to interpret them. We invented them to describe the universe as we perceive it. Thus, some humans have deemed it necessary to draw a distinction between things created by humans and everything else.</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt;Not having sensitivity to the victim and their situation is a really bad thing though, regardless of fault or blame or the situation or crime or anything else involved.

True, but that's a different issue entirely. It just so happens that these commonly go hand in hand. As people who are focused on the objective causes are also less likely to sugarcoat things. For better or worse.

&amp;gt;Imagine yourself in a situation where say your child was murdered. Would it be helpful in any way for you to hear an officer in the hall saying to a reporter "Well, the doors were unlocked."

Makes sense. Probably what lead up to it happening too.

&amp;gt;It's only going to make your healing situation worse, and now you're going to be blaming yourself even more than you probably already were.

But I don't blame myself. That's the difference. Yes, I had a part in the event happening (leaving the kid alone, leaving the door unlocked), but I wasn't the initiator of the crime. I understand this to be the objective situation, regardless of how I feel. Pointing out facts doesn't hurt, it helps.

Take when my house was broken into. I was distraught and worried about my stuff. But I appreciated when told "be sure not to step over near the break in point or touch the door that was busted in, as there's footprints that can be recovered" I made sure to follow that advice.

When they said "you should get a security system to prevent future break-ins" I followed that advice as well. It's not that "I didn't have a security system so I blame myself" nope. It's just one thing that helped lead up to the event. And it's good to know.

More specifically I learned the security system itself doesn't matter. It's just the warning sign out from that does. Which means you can simply stick a sign out there and get the same security, rather than buying the system.

Another aftermath was "should've seen it coming, the people who broke in (neighbors) had parents that scrape vin numbers from cars and sell them." It's a logical thing I didn't consider. Hell, I just figured the neighbors were friendly like the rest of them and that my dad was just a racist fuck.

It *also* gave me the knowledge of hiding my valuables *in my house*, when I leave for long periods of time, so if there *is* a break in, that stuff isn't stolen. This is something I didn't know until I actually was a victim. It's not victim blaming (I don't take it to be), but if I hid my stuff, it wouldn't have been stolen.

Lots of advice to help prevent future problems. And I see it that way.

&amp;gt;Whereas, say a year later and let's pretend you had two kids, your neighbor walked over and said to you, 'Yaknow, I heard about this great new alarm system.'

A year? I'd rather the helpful info be provided immediately, like what I learned with the break-in. Didn't wait no year to get a security system. it was installed ASAP.

&amp;gt;but we have to be sensitive to the victim's needs as well (who the f cares about a door, a child is dead and justice needs to happen).

Perhaps. But telling a person "I'm praying for you" or the equivalent is functionally useless. It gives them 0 information, and doesn't tell them anything they don't know. Whereas giving advice does.

&amp;gt; That insensitivity is why it's argued to be victim blaming, and I don't disagree with that.

I agree. This is the main reason OP posted this thread. He thinks the discussion *should* be focused on that information, rather than simply being pointed out as victim blaming and promptly ignored. I agree with OP. While we shouldn't make the victim feel guilty, we should provide information to help prevent future problems.

&amp;gt;Basically, the at the time of the crime, the victim is incapable of looking at the situation objectively. So keep 'em out of it entirely at that time.

I have no problem looking at events objectively during the time. Hell, that's *all* I can think about. Typically though it's not about past preventative actions, but what's going to happen in the future. Well shit I lost my stuff, what now? Track the guys, find them, call the police, get an alarm system to prevent future break ins, etc. Not "waah I lost my stuff and I feel bad, so I can't think about anything".

Perhaps other people are different, but I like to focus on the helpful things, rather than the pointless ones.

&amp;gt;You may not intend to victim blame if you were to say "Well, everyone knows that area is dangerous." Because it implies stupidity on the part of the victim.

Right, the tone implies blaming the victim.

&amp;gt;Allowing the victim some time before we start talking about all the things they did wrong intentionally or unintentionally isn't necessarily a bad idea. But that is simply because it's hard for a person to talk about a crime without talking about the victim.

I'd disagree here. I'd rather tackle the problem immediately, so it doesn't happen again. Yes, it was awful. No, I don't want it happening again and want to prevent it as much as I can. It seems you (and others) have the thought: yes, it was awful. No, I don't want to talk about how to prevent it in the future. Yes, I'll talk about it later (if I remember).

&amp;gt;In the end though, at the base we agree.

Definitely. I think the main difference is just the when and how.</data>

It's too soon to say if this shift is having a positive, negative, or no change on crime.  I'd also say that making any sort of absolute claim that changes in gun ownership(in either direction) is the primary cause of any shift in crime is pretty statistically dubious.  It definitely is gonna have an affect(though I'm sure people will disagree with what that affect is), but it will only be part of a much larger picture.</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt;People ALREADY KNOW THIS. For some reason, they made a choice to do so anyway. Giving them an "Don't you know this is dangerous!?" message after the fact doesn't do anything but make them feel worse about their decision.

How about a real example of this in action:

My car was broken into a couple weeks ago. It was in a secure garage, and I live in a relatively decent area. It's still dense and urban, though, so property crime is higher than the suburb cities that I could have lived in. I also left an Ikea box in my car. It was broken into, and the box stolen.

Here is advice that I got:

1. Don't live in the urban area, move back to the burbs (completely true, the property crime rate in the burb I used to live in was dramatically lower than where I live now).
2. Don't leave valuables in the car (I hadn't considered a box valuable, but I understand a bit more of the mindset of someone who does this, now).
3. Always identify and park near cameras. Shit, I'd never thought of that! I really hadn't. And I wouldn't have thought of it, unless someone told me.

Now; I was at least partially at fault for moving to the more dangerous area, leaving things in my car, and not parking it in a safer part of the garage. The thief is still to blame for his actions, but *my* actions could have made this less likely to happen. In fact I probably could have avoided the thing entirely by not leaving the box in the car. That's my bad, and in the future i'll avoid victimhood by not doing that.

What's so ethically wrong with advising people on how to improve their odds? Would you say it's morally wrong to give tips to people on how to invest their money?</data>

In your car example, there's not enough information to say which of those entities contributed, and you are focusing entirely on the *people involved*. What about the weather? Mechanical failure? Animals? Any of those can be contributing causes. It has to be analyzed on a case-by-cause basis... which is OP's entire point. Was the driver drunk? Was the pedestrian jaywalking near a blind hill? Did the car dealership sell a car with known brake issues? Is the government licensing incompetent drivers? Did the auto manufacturer fail to issue a recall? Were the parents of the driver giving him a purple nurple at the time? When looking at a specific incident, it's pretty easy to narrow down many of the causes, and you can analyze the rest of the potential causes to see if they contributed.</data>

Add in the fact that the situation would likely be even more stressful than the average SWAT raid since the civilians have no knowledge of any of the other participants and were completely unprepared in the moment, and do you still feel that training which would necessarily be brief and infrequent enough to allow for these people to have other jobs would be extensive enough to mitigate dangers I brought up?

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt; Yes, but human is easy to define.

Somewhat, but what about when we're looking back at human evolution? The names of species become quite muddled when we look back on the tree of life.

&amp;gt; Humans are derived from nature themselves, at least according to the concept of evolution. Hence, everything we are and do is simply a product of nature. Something can't be derived from unnatural, when humans created it. This is unless you assume that we were created outside nature (e.g. there was earth/'the nature' and god place us on the planet. Or some external force interfered, e.g. aliens manipulated evolution or something crazy like that, then we wouldn't be natural anymore).

I don't follow. Why does it imply this at all? Using the word unnatural doesn't do this.

Just because humans were derived from nature themselves it doesn't mean they don't have some kind of agency. The point is to differentiate between things that subatomic particles do when not acted upon by an outside agent and the things that are.

If you say that an external force (like aliens) interfering with evolution would make humans not natural anymore then you essentially agree with me. I am saying that the things humans exert force on are not natural, not that humans themselves are not natural. I am pretty sure nobody is arguing that humans are unnatural in this thread.

&amp;gt; It does have a meaning but not the one people think it has. It doesn't 'good', natural means part of nature and humans are part of nature. It has nothing to do with my opinion, it's simple logic.

I don't see what this has to do with my argument, frankly. Humans are a part of nature, but the MacBook Pro I am typing this on is not because it was created by agents purposefully.</data>

It is solely, only, entirely, and completely the agency of the criminal that caused, is at fault for, and is blameworthy that the crime occurred.

At best, one might, as has been discussed in this thread, be able to helpfully point out that a victim might be able to reduce their chances of being victimized by choosing different actions.

There's a bunch of things that lead up to the events. Poor risk evaluation and lack of care towards safety of the victim is one such reason.

Then there's the person carrying out the act. Which might be for a variety of reasons. Maybe they are good, but starving and need money. Maybe they just have something wrong with their brain.

What you are doing is "blaming the ill" and it could be rephrased to make you look like a douchebag as well.

Yes, but human is easy to define.

&amp;gt; Why would something existing imply that a god or aliens created us?

Humans are derived from nature themselves, at least according to the concept of evolution. Hence, everything we are and do is simply a product of nature. Something can't be derived from unnatural, when humans created it. This is unless you assume that we were created outside nature (e.g. there was earth/'the nature' and god place us on the planet. Or some external force interfered, e.g. aliens manipulated evolution or something crazy like that, then we wouldn't be natural anymore).

&amp;gt; Just because people use words in ways you dislike doesn't mean those words don't have meanings.

It does have a meaning but not the one people think it has. It doesn't 'good', natural means part of nature and humans are part of nature. It has nothing to do with my opinion, it's simple logic.

btw. is should say (edited that)

Most likely apprehend them and go through rehabilitation. Or perhaps focus on what made them a criminal in the first case (which rehabilitation does on a case-by-case).

Either way, I typically stay out of gun control conversations. I don't really have a view. I think they should be accessible by those who need or want to use them as a hobby. But certainly shouldn't be given to dangerous people. The solution seems unclear.

More gun control doesn't lead to less gun crimes. Seeing as people illegally obtain them anyway. Similar to drug usage.</data>

I think France is in a tough spot in how to react to this. There would be even stronger calls for an anti-islam and anti-immigration policies. These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government. I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway). 

I think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying. Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse, and society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries. I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the "not one of us" (pack) mentality and escalation of "police state".
Change my view.

I don't think it's fucked up. The only problem I have with it is that my parents have financial problems, and I started from a problematic position, which I'm working my way out of. But other than that things are fine.

&amp;gt;I don't think you should be suggesting everyone act like you. 

Perhaps. I think the world would be better if they did. 

&amp;gt;We can't all divorce ourselves from our families 

Did I ever suggest that? I suggested treating them as a regular person, one that can be fucked up rather than putting them on a pedestal. But if they are great, then so be it.

&amp;gt;and just stay home to avoid danger.

Yes, because I simply stay home for every second of every day. I don't see why avoiding danger is problematic for people. It's fairly simple. Use your brain, be careful about the risks, and when in doubt, be skeptical. You don't have to stay home to do that.

&amp;gt;You lack empathy

Perhaps, though I always find the word ill-defined. If you could clarify, I'd appreciate it.

&amp;gt;and I think it's due to your shit life making you hate people.

Not really a shit life. I'm not where I'd like to be financially, sure. Also it's not the reason I hate people. I dislike people because most have hypocritical views that they don't think about, don't care about forming an identity, spend money they don't have, and make decisions that aren't beneficial to themselves.

&amp;gt; That sucks, but it also makes you bad at understanding others 

I understand others fine. I don't understand why they don't care. 

&amp;gt;and proposing how they should behave.

That they should assess risks and act accordingly? And not let emotion cloud their judgement? How is that not an ideal way of living? Perhaps my idea of ideal is off. </data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt; The root of the problem is the illness. Not the person or situation.

Agreed. And this should be the focus of the discussion, because it is the root of the problem.

&amp;gt;The conversations afterwards should focus on how to prevent the problem in any way possible.

Sure, to prevent the problem. Not in "any way possible" though. If you killed yourself, you'd never be a victim of a crime. Is that really worth discussing? If you really believe the answer is yes please just stop posting and see a doctor. There's no point in continuing.

&amp;gt;Like, being sure to lock your door. You could cry 'victim-blaming' to that. But it's not. It's giving an objective rational explanation for something that lead to the problem.

As my original post says, it completely depends on how the topic is approached. Yes, you can share information to an uneducated person to prevent bad situations from occurring. 

&amp;gt;"Fault" shouldn't even be part of the conversation, IMO.

Well, you made it a part of the argument. The topic is victim blaming, and that includes arguing about the definition of victim blaming because not everyone agrees to the extent of it.

I don't agree this definition you use is relevant at all, and its not the normal definition that the average person uses, so you just make this all confusing. The mere existence of a person in a place does not place them "at fault" for anything. All you are saying is "things happen because things". The sun rises because the earth rotates, so the earth is at fault for the sun rising. Sure, whatever. That has no relevance to anything we're discussing.

So maybe we should use the word "culpable" instead of "fault" here to clarify exactly what we mean. Culpable simply means "to blame". 

Is the victim culpable for being mugged? No. To suggest otherwise would be victim blaming. Yes: Regardless of personal responsibility, *because that's a completely separate issue*. 

And that's my entire point in my original response. Victim blaming and the discussions had afterward *are in no way related to each other* when the discussion is had correctly UNLESS you can prove culpability, like your example of a person getting punched when provoking a drunk guy. You can prove the guy was provoked, because there would be witnesses. 

That is where the line gets blurry, on "unless you can prove culpability". Is the victim culpable for their house being robbed because they didn't lock their door? Well, we don't frankly know. Would the robbery have happened if the door had been locked? It's completely possible. We have no proof either way. 

That is the exact moment where victim blaming occurs. These assumptions. A person makes an argument on the assumption that the robbery would not have occurred if the door had been locked, despite no proof. (Don't jump the gun here, finish reading.) We assume the woman was raped because she was wearing a short dress. We assume the guy was mugged because of the money clip. We have no proof of any of these assumptions. 

Can we discuss these things? Wearing a short dress, carrying a money clip, locking your door? YES. Of course we can. But not in regards to the specific victim, because we have no proof they are related. Involving the specific victim shifts the entire discussion away from the root of the problem, as you said!

I can say "That's an unsafe neighborhood, we shouldn't carry expensive things around with us." That is an intelligent reasonable discussion on personal safety that does not include the victim in any regard. The two issues are separated and now the conversation is valuable. </data>

I'm not a biologist but there are different definitions of human based on the stage in evolution.

&amp;gt; The point is to differentiate between things that subatomic particles do when not acted upon by an outside agent and the things that are.

I don't follow either. What are subatomic particles doing or not? What 'outside agent'?

&amp;gt; I am saying that the things humans exert force on are not natural, not that humans themselves are not natural.

How can humans be natural but not their behavior? E.g. humans are social because there were evolutionary advantages to this, also humans are violent because there were evolutionary advantages to this. 

&amp;gt; Humans are a part of nature, but the MacBook Pro I am typing this on is not because it was created by agents purposefully.

No, the MacBook is natural too when you think it through. That's the same as e.g. an animal digging a hole. We're just sophisticated animals, so we produce sophisticated tools, that's all. I know people don't call MacBooks natural, but in fact they are. </data>

That's for you to decide. You can make bad decisions - that's life. But if you don't know that area is bad, or didn't know not to wear a certain color in that area (because rival gangs), then being advised about not going there could prevent you from becoming a victim.

&amp;gt;If you don't have information the victim doesn't have, you're not helping by adding your uninformed opinion to theirs.

We don't always know if the victim even has that information, or if they know where to get it, or even if it occurs to them to check. Plenty of people shrug and say "it could have happened to anyone, there was nothing I could do." It's genuinely useful to try to help them from becoming a victim again - and they can spread the info to others to help prevent victims piling up.

&amp;gt;All you're doing is blaming the victim.

That's *not* blaming the victim. You're not absolving the assailant of responsibility ("he couldn't help himself"), you're still placing blame firmly on the person who committed the crime. They're the ones to be charged. But that doesn't mean the victim is without fault. Their choices led to that situation. They contributed to their victimhood. That doesn't mean they're to blame, it means they have some fault in the matter - even if it's a small amount. Understanding that doesn't mean you're blaming the victim.

And again, why is trying to help victims (or potential victims) take precautions a bad thing?

&amp;gt;The most dangerous "neighborhood" in America for blacks to live in is apparently Nebraska. It has an annual murder incidence of around 34/100,000. Should all the blacks in the state move out?

I can't make decisions for other people. But I *could* advise blacks in Nebraska of that factoid, and give them tips on areas to avoid, or suggest behaviors to avoid. Maybe they move out, that's fine. That's probably reducing their chances of becoming a murder victim. The decision still lies with them, but they should understand the things that put them at risk, and how to reduce it.

On the flip side, would you say that nobody should try to avoid becoming a victim?</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt; That being said, people can reduce risk if they stay away from dangerous areas. Opting to avoid a safe route in favor of a dangerous one increases the risk of becoming a victim. People are responsible for risks that they assume. 

So, if I'm on a motorcycle stopped at a red light and another motorist in a large vehicle approaches from beind, fails to stop in time, and it results in a collision and ultimately my death...  By your measure here, I am still part of the cause of the accident, is that correct?  It would clearly be the other driver's fault in this case, but would I be part of the cause?  Keep in mind that on the motorcycle in the scenario, I have essentially no power over the event (not necessarily 100% true, but lets assume I didn't see it coming and thus didn't/couldn't avoid the collision).

A mugging event is similar in that all of the act of "mugging" was at the hand of someone else, and not the victim.  The victim has essentially no hand in the action primarily because they are the direct object of the action (and they're not acting upon themselves).  Since the victim is not actually contributing to the act, then how can the victim be considered to be the cause at all?  You could argue that walking down mugger's alley was a bad choice and that choice is how we can, except then we would have to consider an absurdly long chain of events when considering cause for any situation.</data>

      <data key="d0">I would say that the difficulty here is in assigning "causal factors" accurately. Let's take your example: 

&amp;gt;The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged.

Actually, it would have also prevented your being mugged had you left 10 minutes later. It further likely would have prevented your mugging had one of you been armed. If the mugger's spouse had a fight with them before they left the house to mug you, and this delayed them so you passed before they did, it would have prevented your mugging. 

Your being mugged is a *statistical* outcome, not attributable to any one behavior on your part. In this case, the root cause is exactly and only the mugger choosing to mug you. There's no other causal factor that would have actually *prevented* the situation, only changed the probabilities, and you can't really trust probabilities to guide specific behavior in specific situations. 

Absolute "causation" isn't a helpful concept in cases like this. The causal factors of one individual trial of a statistical experiment aren't very important. The response to a statistical problem is not to change behavior on individual trials of the experiment, it's to address the root cause of the statistical problem. 

We can't, nor should we, do everything in our power to reduce all possibility of danger. Surely you can see the reductio ad absurdum here. 

We have to weigh the effectiveness of our strategies against the costs and benefits. If avoiding one part of town reduces your risk by (let's convert everything to dollars here for ease of calculation) $0.10, but it costs you $0.50 in inconvenience, exercise of your rights, enjoyment of life, and every other factor (most of which are very hard to calculate) then you "should" not avoid that part of town, even if it led to your being mugged.

It's not necessarily "wrong" to point out these statistical factors in order to help people make return-on-investment calculations, if that's your real goal. It's not too helpful, because people don't really have enough information, nor training in statistical theory, to apply that information. 

But it's really very hard to come up with true valuations of these factors. Don't make the mistake of thinking that because it's "obvious to you" that a part of town is dangerous that it is worthwhile to tell someone they should avoid that part of town. 

If you want to tell people in general that traveling in that part of town has a 0.01% chance of resulting in their being mugged and robbed of their pocket change (let's say the average is $100, with another $900 in lost peace of mind), by all means let them know that the expected cost of that behavior is $0.10, so that they can decide if it's worth that cost to them.

And that's about accurate for the most dangerous parts of any town, and for actual losses typically incurred. If you exaggerate the danger, you're not doing anyone any favors, and are actually doing them harm, statistically.

When you talk to an actual *victim* about these things, realize that they *already* probably have a vastly inflated opinion about the risks of their behavior, because they have suffered an unlikely outcome in that regard. 

Almost in every case, if you're speaking to a *victim*, it would be more accurate to *downplay* the risks that they took, if your goal is to actually statistically help them. 

If someone is in a plane crash and is injured, your telling them that riding planes is dangerous is true as far as it goes... it's just a lot less dangerous than driving, which is what they're likely to do instead. 

Societally speaking, we have to be very careful what we warn people about, because everyone's mileage varies. </data>

If "someone" gets mugged, it's the mugger's fault.

If "you" get mugged, then it's a slightly different question with a potentially different answer.

In the first case, you focus on the mugger. In the second you focus on the victim. And victim blaming only ever happens when you focus on the victim (which is typically what happens).</data>

      <data key="d0">Rape is different to many other crimes.  
In the case of burglary of a house or car, there is no risk of significant harm from discussing the circumstances and risks which could have been reduced. 

What rape victims very often tell us is that questioning about circumstances by friends and family can be horribly traumatic, in some cases as bad as the original rape.  
Even the questioning by trained and experienced professionals that is necessary for them to do their job is often horrible.  

It is not necessary for non-raped people to understand *why* their questions and discussions about risk are so frequently and severely damaging to the victims, though that understanding would be good.  

The main thing is for non-raped people to realise that their "questions" are also statements, that their "advice" is typically superfluous at best, and that it is jerkful to attempt to educate themselves by blundering into conversation with a rapee when the internet is awash with first-person accounts and resources on the subject.</data>

There seems to be a common misconception that those of us that carry actually WANT to use deadly force.  People seem to think that we'll pull at the drop of a hat.  While there are undoubtedly a few a-holes among us that do, the *VAST* majority simply do not think that way.

In point of fact, *most* people who carry understand the weight of the tool at their disposal.  We understand that if we believe the situation warrants use of a gun then we've decided this is a life-or-death situation.  Thankfully, most average citizens, gun carriers or not, never encounter such situations.  Speaking for myself, I only have once in my life and it was more than 25 years now... and, I managed to survive it without a gun.  But when you do, the alternatives are facing it with a tool that we all know is effective at it's job, or going at it without that tool.  Even though I survived my one such case without a gun I wouldn't want to make the gamble a second time.

No, the truth is that most people who carry understand that carrying a gun makes you the pussy in the room.  It makes you the person that backs down from any and all confrontations long before they escalate to the point of needing a gun.  They understand that they are the ones that take the insults and just walk away.  We keep our anger in check at all times.

We're also the ones that are paying attention to our surroundings at all times, not burying our faces in our phones and whatnot, because we understand that situational awareness is the key to staying alive whether you have a gun or not.  We notice the little details.  We move to the other side of the street if we think we see trouble coming (whether it "looks bad" or not).  We're the ones that, more importantly, won't even *BE* on that street in the first place.

Like I said, I'm sure you can find examples of people who carry who do so with the wrong mindset.  But if you spend any time around people who do carry you'll quickly realize those people are few and far between.  We're perfectly normal people, just like you, who just so happen to not want to be in a situation where we can't defend our lives.  Simple as that.</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt;and it is misconstrued as victim-blaming. 

Because people take things emotionally instead of objectively. Notice how none of the 'victim-blamers' use 'fault', nor do they say that the person was the *reason* for the crime. They simply suggest things and possibly say "X was a bad move. That was stupid."

It's like calling someone an idiot for not locking their doors when they immediately get broken into. They are an idiot. Especially if the intruder was simply looking for an unlocked door.

It's not victim-blaming. It's pointing out the obvious cause for why it happened *to them*. Granted, locking your door could still make you the victim, had they busted it down, or went through a window. In which case, perhaps the victim could do nothing more. They would then not be 'blamed' because there's no obvious cause for why they were picked.

It's like hanging around your creepy uncle simply because he's your uncle. If you get raped, you should've seen it coming. Rapists come from your circle of acquaitences most of the time, and if he's creepy and being rapist-like, you should probably avoid him. Not hang around because of familial bonds.

&amp;gt;The behavior of the perpetrator needs to be changed, not the behavior of the victim in most cases.

You could easily equate the perpetrator to a victim as well. To take some silly examples: Mind control, hypnosis, being tricked, etc. And some serious ones: Being drunk, Mental illness, desperate measures (commit this crime or you die!).

By saying it's the perpetrators fault with no reason for the cause, you are "victim-blaming" the perpetrator. Yes, the perpetrator is the initiator of the crime. Yes, changing their behavior patterns will reduce crime in the long-term. No, this will not prevent Mary from being raped. Mary can still be raped by the thousands of other rapists. It's not John's fault that he happened to be the one to do it. He simply happened to be the cause.

Yes, it's John's fault John raped someone. But that action could've been caused by a number of things, as I mentioned.

What needs to be addressed is the specific conditions that allowed for the crime, rather than simply who's to blame.

If a house it broken into, provide better security for the house/neighborhood, as well as look into why the perp did it. Did they need money? Perhaps the solution is to relocate them to a better living condition, where they aren't as desperate. That's one way to solve the problem.

Maybe it's the area in general? In this case, perhaps it's the culture that needs to change. Less focus on aggression-based media, perhaps. More lessons on personal safety, and personal-responsibility, as well as teaching risk-assessment. Not just to the 'victims' but to the 'perpetrators' as well. Chances are that the perp is just a regular guy who got thrown into a bad situation either mentally or physically.

Do you blame alchoholics for being the way they are? To line up with your views, you should answer NO. Yet, the only person responsible is the alchoholic themselves. If this drunk person then committed a crime while drunk, is it their fault?

At this point your logical answer should be no. Yet your other answers would *also* point to YES (being that the perpetrator is the one at fault always).

My answer is yes to both. It's yes to being an alcoholic (you didn't have to drink, and could technically stop). And it's yes to committing a crime while choosing to be drunk.

Lots of causes, and it's important to look at them objectively, rather than simply trying to make everything about a good guy and bad guy.</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt; Someone posts blunt advice, and then gets called out for victim blaming because everyone is an emotional train wreck and siding with the victim, rather than objectively looking at the event.

Not having sensitivity to the victim and their situation is a really bad thing though, regardless of fault or blame or the situation or crime or anything else involved. 

Imagine yourself in a situation where say your child was murdered. Would it be helpful in any way *for you* to hear an officer in the hall saying to a reporter "Well, the doors were unlocked." It's only going to make your healing situation worse, and now you're going to be blaming yourself even more than you probably already were.

Whereas, say a year later and let's pretend you had two kids, your neighbor walked over and said to you, 'Yaknow, I heard about this great new alarm system.'

It's important to have that discussion (we should lock our doors), but we have to be sensitive to the victim's needs as well (who the f cares about a door, a child is dead and justice needs to happen). That insensitivity is why it's argued to be victim blaming, and I don't disagree with that.

Basically, the at the time of the crime, the victim is incapable of looking at the situation objectively. So keep 'em out of it entirely *at that time*.

But all of that is dependent on this point as well:

&amp;gt;But this act is still called victim blaming by many people.

Even though it's not intended to be blaming, it usually is. As I've argued before, it's a very natural tendency to victim blame for humans. It's the immediate instinct and response, basically nature. And as I've also argued before, it's all about how you approach the subject.

You may not intend to victim blame if you were to say "Well, *everyone* knows that area is dangerous." Because it implies stupidity on the part of the victim. Sure, I can understand it's not *intended* to blame, but it does blame. This is why it's very difficult. It's all human nature to jump to assumptions, fill in the blanks, and mentally protect ourselves by suggesting 'That would never happen to *me* cause I know better'. 

That reason alone is a good reason to avoid the first point - immediately jumping into that 'blunt' advice. That's a bit of a double-edged sword, and I'm not advocating either way (about timing), but as they say 'time heals all wounds'. Allowing the victim some time before we start talking about *all the things they did wrong* intentionally or unintentionally isn't necessarily a bad idea. But that is simply because it's hard for a person to talk about a crime without talking about the victim. But we can, and we should, do exactly that.

In the end though, at the base we agree.

You can take measures to reduce your risk, but failure to reduce risk is not causing something to happen. At what point have you sufficiently reduced risk to remove your causal contribution? Let's take a fatal car accident (other driver at fault):

* Is wearing a seatbelt enough?
* Driving a big, heavy car?
* Only driving on empty streets?

Is the only way to prevent "causing" your fatal accident to not drive at all? It's easy to point to the things you are willing to avoid, and say others ought not have done them. If you work downtown and don't get off until late, is it reasonable to have them stay overnight in the office? Is the fact that they have that job the reason they got mugged?

&amp;gt; You dismiss it as a "minor contribution" to the cause. But if there are certain precautions one might take in order to protect themselves, why not take them?

How many precautions are enough? It's reasonable to take the precaution of not going on message boards and talking about rape fantasies. Is it reasonable to cover up as if you were in the middle east just so a man won't rape you? That is the justification for how the women dress; it's that their dress evokes urges in men.

&amp;gt; Throughout your response, you continually use "blame" language: "at fault", "full blame", etc., when I never placed any blame on the victim.

I'm not sure you can separate cause and blame. Your sentiment is essentially "if you hadn't been doing x, then y would not have happened". You can dress it up by saying it's cause and not blame, but it is blame.

&amp;gt; Let's be realistic here. There are certain legitimate circumstances that are more dangerous. So if you avoid putting yourself in them, you might avoid danger. That doesn't mean you "deserve" a bad outcome if you do put yourself in those situations.

Wearing a revealing outfit is a dangerous activity? The vast majority of women wearing revealing outfits are not raped, yet, that is trotted out when a women in a revealing outfit happens to be raped. If they aren't wearing a revealing outfit, we pick another reason (out late at night, at a party, drinking, etc). The point is people do these things safely the overwhelming majority of the time. The reason they were raped is that circumstances *beyond their control* put them in the wrong place at the wrong time. You can dress conservatively, not drink, not go out, not party, and what life do you have now?</data>

DING DING DING

These are often bullshit ideas.  As I wrote elsewhere, everyone I know in NYC who was mugged was in the morning on the way to work.  

Scantily dressed women aren't more likely to be raped.  

There are no clear rules for most crimes.  

But, yes, if I don't lock my window I make it easier for myself to be burglarized, but I in no way caused it.

&amp;gt;ertain actions/wearing certain things still may be true ertain actions/wearing certain things still may be true 

The problem is, this is a myth.  Of course I want to know the safest way to carry myself and I try to be safe.  But the thing is you can look at any crime and come up with something that the victim did.  

By the end, if women left the house alone, or after dark, or without a man she is part of the "cause."  

The thing is the OP is talking about causation, and that is what I am addressing.

      <data key="d0">I guess I look at it this way- there have absolutely been times when gun ownership, or carrying weapons on ones person in general was more prevalent than it is today. Those time periods/places did not enjoy lower rates of violent death. 

Consider the "wild west." Obviously it wasn't nearly as full of gun battles as the movies make it seem, but according [this study] (http://cjrc.osu.edu/homicide-rates-american-west-randolph-roth) the murder rate was "extraordinarily high by today's standard." 

Looking at the rest of the thread, I think I see what might be a flaw in our collective logic. The incidents that stand out most in our heads are events like Paris or Aurora or Columbine- premeditated shootings with the intent of inflicting a lot of casualties. If the staff at Charlie Hebdo or Columbine High had guns, they certainly might have been able to end these incidents earlier. They also might have inflicted more casualties with stray bullets. These types of hypothetical calculations aren't really helpful, in my opinion.

But lets assume that more guns makes mass shootings less likely. Would this actually make a more heavily armed society a more polite one?

I don't think it would, because though premeditated murders could well be less likely, accidental deaths, unplanned homicides, and suicides would like increase. 

This study found that owning a gun makes one more likely to die from suicide *and* homicide. Of course, that's correlation, so there might be some third factor at play that makes gun owners more likely to b targets of crime or clinically depressed, but it certainly suggests that owning a gun doesn't automatically make you safer.
http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/160/10/929.full
 
Whether or not more guns would prevent events like today's isn't the issue (though I am inclined to say they wouldn't necessarily do that), it seems like a greater proliferation of weapons would be more dangerous for a number of other reasons.</data>

Sure it is. Why do you think I moved to literally the safest city in the US (by crime rate)? I avoided areas where muggers would be. As a result, I've never been mugged.

&amp;gt;While you may think that muggers will be in shady neighborhoods, if everyone but other muggers avoids a place, very quickly muggers are going to change their MO.

So you are saying that muggers would mug someone in a police station? Somehow I really doubt that. Apparently you don't do risk-assesment, but I'm pretty sure the muggers do. Which is why they hang out in shady locations.

&amp;gt;Someone else earlier mentioned that it is unlikely you will get mugged in times square, however, pickpocketing is rampant there and yet thousands of tourists walk through it every day.

Sure. Pickpocketing is discrete. And is something to be wary of when you are in a crowd, since it's easy to do when there's lots of people around. In this case, be sure to move your things to your front pockets (where it's hard to access by a 3rd party), and be sure to zip up your bags, preferably locking them. And hold them close.

This is true of any populated area. Just like you don't leave your shit lying around. Amusingly, I lived in 'the safest city in the US' (determined by crime rate) people left their shit all around. I come from an area high in crime. If you left your shit like that it'd get stolen. So people knew not to do it. In this safe location, people did it anyway. if they got their shit stolen, it's their fault for leaving it there, not taking proper precaution.

I've never had something stolen, besides the one point when I was growing up (no power over where I lived) and my house got broken into. It was the sketchy neighbors who scraped the vin numbers off cars and sold them. Obviously they were no good. All my life I told my parents how shitty of a place we live is, they didn't care, bunkered down with an expensive house anyway. And voila, we got broken into. In response, we got a security system (which stays mostly off, but the sign is in the yard), and new neighbors. No more incidents or problems. Yet, there's problems in the immediate area (like next street over).

So yes, there's things you can do to minimize risk, depending on what you want to minimize risk of.</data>

These people aren't idiots -- they understand empirically, as everyone does, that getting drunk late at night at a frat house and passing out on some guy's futon creates an above-average risk of sexual assault, while avoiding such behavior may reduce risk.

But ubiquitous analogies like "thieves...steal" overlook the fact that stealing has been taboo in almost every culture since the beginning of time.  Someone who breaks into your car to take your shit knows perfectly well that he's committing theft, and what he's doing is wrong, and it will negatively affect you.  There's no point in trying to educate him.  

A drunken frat boy who has sex with a passed out girl, though, might legitimately fail to understand that what he's doing is legally considered rape, could get him expelled/jailed, and could fuck up her life.  For most of human history, including recent U.S. history, this type of behavior was okay.  It was the natural consequence of a woman acting "loose," and it *was* her fault.  And even in the current environment, lines can get (ugh) blurred.

So, it's valid to call for some messaging and education correcting that perception and affirming that we're in a new paradigm, where you really do need consent.

I'm not saying campus anti-rape campaigns are never irrational, never go overboard, etc.  Of course they do.  But there is a kernel of validity to what feminists are saying. </data>

At no point did I suggest that I personally should be going around pointing out to every victim of crime exactly what they should have done differently. That's absurd. There's been a very interesting conversation in this thread about if and when it is appropriate to have that conversation with a victim of crime, but if that talk does need to be had, obviously it should be coming from someone with a complete understanding of the facts and the best interests of the victim at heart.

But even that wasn't my point. What I'm saying is that, IMO, we should analyze crimes that happen after the fact to determine what, if any, behaviours, situations, or choices tend to lead to victimization. We do this without assigning any fault to the victim for these choices. They don't even have to hear about the conclusions or be involved in the process if they don't want to (besides via the testimony they give, of course). We are simply trying to objectively determine which factors correspond to increased risk. We should gather data this way, and use it to educate people on risk factors so they are better able to make good risk assessments in the future.

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt;The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.

This paragraph makes a couple of assumptions involving how our culture views "cause" and responsibility.  From a deterministic point of view, where you still have the freedom to choose where you go but everything else is predetermined, you entering a bad area is the "cause" of your mugging.  But that doesn't make you responsible for being mugged, because every individual is, legally, recognized as having the same freedom of choice that you have.  So the mugger chose to mug you.  That choice was the "cause," not your decision to enter an unsafe area.

You increasing your chance of being mugged didn't actually cause your mugging.

Maybe this is just pedantic, because ultimately there is a correlation between entering that area and getting mugged.  However, problems arise when people think they know how certain things correlate when they actually don't.  Humans are actually quite bad at probabilities and intuitively understanding them.  So it then becomes a problem when people think "i'm not blaming the victim, I'm recognizing a correlation," because they don't usually have a good reason to believe that they are really recognizing a correlation.

A great example of that problem is when the cause of a rape is correlated with what the victim was wearing.  First, culturally, the rapist is to blame, just like the mugger above, regardless of mitigating circumstances.  But second, there isn't actually a correlation between the chances a person will get raped and the clothes they are wearing.  People erroneously think that there is a correlation because it "makes sense" and they fall victim to confirmation bias.</data>

That simple statement makes so many assumptions, and that is where the victim blaming is occurring. Saying "Mary really shouldn't" is victim blaming. It doesn't matter how that sentence ends.

Did Mary make a mistake? Sure. She was in an unsafe area. But people make mistakes, shit happens, etc. Let's have a discussion about that unsafe area and unsafe areas in general, not about Mary. There are plenty of reasons Mary could have been in an unsafe area, including simply not knowing the area is unsafe. Did Mary make mistakes, not have the right preparation, could have done something different? Sure. So could any victim of any crime. Let's talk about preparations the average person can make. Let's talk about what signs we should be aware of to identify unsafe places. Let's talk about the causes of crime. Let's talk about community improvement. So on and on and on.

&amp;gt;That is not something we can do much about. But we can drastically alter what our individual risk is, and in many cases lower it to near zero, by simply educating ourselves about proper self-defense measures and taking them vigilantly. 

Well, I disagree we can't do things about it, but it takes groups of people instead of individuals, I understand. These discussions are where those changes start, by educating ourselves and our neighbors.

Correct. But that's not what you first said. There is a difference between "Mary shouldn't have gone there because she will get mugged" and "That's not a safe area, muggings happen a lot there." 

The first sentence makes so many assumptions. What if Mary lives there? Works there? Got lost? Got kicked out of a car? Got drugged and had her kidney removed for the black market and dumped there? Kid ran away and she's looking for him? So on and on. It directs the conversation away from the mugging and to Mary and why Mary is in the wrong. And the funny part is no one partaking in this discussion has any idea why Mary is there or what happened around this situation (because I've never provided a reason, just possibilities), yet that's the thing people keep bringing up. Mary shouldn't. Well, you don't know. 

The second sentence talks about the crime, the situation, and begins a discussion on personal safety. Is it relevant to discuss bad areas (the place Mary was in)? Yes! Is it valuable to discuss ways a person can protect themselves? Yes! Is it valuable to discuss signs of danger? Yes! Is it valuable to discuss ways to avoid bad situations? Yes! That conversation is incredibly important and valuable and we should all have these conversations. Mary is not involved in these conversations, and should simply be a prompt for the dialog.</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt;Sure, to prevent the problem. Not in "any way possible" though. If you killed yourself, you'd never be a victim of a crime. Is that really worth discussing? If you really believe the answer is yes please just stop posting and see a doctor. There's no point in continuing.

Lol. But that's why a discussion is necessary, rather than to drown it out with "VICTIM BLAMING LA LA LA CANT HEAR YOU!" While technically suicide would prevent further crimes being done to you, it's not an optimal solution. Just like being in your house 24/7 would work, but is also not optimal. At some point there's a bit of risk, and each person has a tolerance for that risk.

&amp;gt;As my original post says, it completely depends on how the topic is approached. Yes, you can share information to an uneducated person to prevent bad situations from occurring.

This is the point being addressed. Whenever you attempt to share advice to the victim, it gets construed as victim blaming. Which isn't the intent most of the time.

&amp;gt;Well, you made it a part of the argument. The topic is victim blaming, and that includes arguing about the definition of victim blaming because not everyone agrees to the extent of it.

For this arguement/discussion, yes. But I meant more of in the terms of what we should do to fix an individual problem. We shouldn't say "it's this random criminal's fault!" just like we shouldn't say "it's this random victim's fault!" we should say: here's x/y/z of what happened and what lead up to it. Some actions were done by both parties. Here's a way to fix it to prevent future things from happening.

By pointing fault and blame, it's being counterproductive. Both are at fault, technically.

&amp;gt;I don't agree this definition you use is relevant at all, and its not the normal definition that the average person uses, so you just make this all confusing. The mere existence of a person in a place does not place them "at fault" for anything. All you are saying is "things happen because things".

This is true though. How do you define fault in a useful way? IMO you can't. The most accurate would be to describe the causes that lead up to it. The least accurate and useful would be to say it's the criminal, which we already have a word for. What use do you have by using the word when discussing an event? Note that the people who call out 'victim blaming' are the ones using fault. Not the people giving advice.

&amp;gt;So maybe we should use the word "culpable" instead of "fault" here to clarify exactly what we mean. Culpable simply means "to blame".

Why do we need to blame anything? Why not simply state the causes and actions that lead up the the event and how to avoid them? Blaming things is useless.

&amp;gt;Is the victim culpable for being mugged? No. To suggest otherwise would be victim blaming. Yes: Regardless of personal responsibility, because that's a completely separate issue.

I would say they are, in part, responsible for the event to occur. If they weren't present, the event wouldn't occur. Whether their intention was to cause it or not doesn't matter (it does when apprehending criminals though). It's like if you pulled the table cloth and a glass fell. You caused the glass to fall. You may not have intended it, but that's what happened when you did your actions. Don't pull the table cloth, and the glass won't fall (whoops, victim blaming, I forgot).

&amp;gt;And that's my entire point in my original response. Victim blaming and the discussions had afterward are in no way related to each other when the discussion is had correctly UNLESS you can prove culpability, like your example of a person getting punched when provoking a drunk guy. You can prove the guy was provoked, because there would be witnesses.

But what if provoking him was unintended? Simply someone speaking their mind, unintentionally provoking the other person, who then initiated the conflict? This can be stretched further to thieves. Is flashing around expensive gadgets provoking a thief? Either way, both are causes in the same way: helping build motive for a crime/problem.

The point isn't to point fault at the victim. It's to help the victim realize what they can do to prevent future similar problems. Whether it be the direct cause or not. Driving accidents are solely caused by driving, regardless who's at fault. So if you don't drive, you won't get into one. Simple. It's "victim blaming" according to you, but also valuable advice.

&amp;gt;That is where the line gets blurry, on "unless you can prove culpability". Is the victim culpable for their house being robbed because they didn't lock their door? Well, we don't frankly know. Would the robbery have happened if the door had been locked? It's completely possible. We have no proof either way.

This is why it's pointless to discuss. As for who's responsible is for the law to decide. What we are talking about here is what the victim can do to make themselves safer from future crimes. Which is somehow construed as victim blaming. We aren't saying "the victim's actions forced the crime to take place". We are saying "the victim can take certain actions to reduce the chance of being a victim."

&amp;gt;That is the exact moment where victim blaming occurs. These assumptions. A person makes an argument on the assumption that the robbery would not have occurred if the door had been locked, despite no proof. 

Not quite, they make the assumption that the robbery has a less chance of happening if the door is locked. Which is statically true.

&amp;gt;We assume the woman was raped because she was wearing a short dress. 

False assumption, but sure. I'd agree it's important to note what actually contributes to the causes, rather than what we perceive it to be.

&amp;gt;We assume the guy was mugged because of the money clip. 

People get mugged for money. People flashing around money are mugged more often. Thus, flashing around money makes you have a higher chance of getting mugged. Avoid flashing around money, and you'll reduce the chance you get mugged.

It's not that simply doing the act of pulling out money makes you automatically get mugged. But that it's tempting to criminals, and definitely increases the risk of a mugging.

&amp;gt;We have no proof of any of these assumptions

Sure we do. We have research/statistics that show that locks decrease burglars, 'looking poor' decreases muggings, etc. I think the "short dress" thing is the only one unfounded. IIRC, most rapes are done by people they are familiar with, so clothing isn't as much of an issue.

&amp;gt;Can we discuss these things? Wearing a short dress, carrying a money clip, locking your door? YES. Of course we can. But not in regards to the specific victim, because we have no proof they are related.

Right. But we cans suggest these things as future actions to take to reduce risk. Not saying that's what prompted the event (naturally). But it might be a contributing cause that can be reduced or removed.

&amp;gt;Involving the specific victim shifts the entire discussion away from the root of the problem, as you said!

True. The specific victim isn't all that important to the discussion, other than to look at what *actually* was a cause. The "victim blaming" is mostly (from what I see) trying to give this advice *to* the victim. Not saying it caused it, but saying "hey, don't flash money around. Not saying you did, but it's a good thing to keep in mind if you don't want to be mugged."

Naturally if you say "you're dumb for flashing money around." that's bad, not useful, etc. The implication is the above sentence, but it comes out as victim blaming and assuming that was the cause (when it might not have been).

And I think this is the real issue. People who call out victim blaming see the latter. The people who get called victim blamers attempt to do the former and sometimes appear as the latter.

But sometimes it's a specific cause. Person walked into X street and got mugged. X street is known to have a lot of muggings. Giving them advice to stay away from X street is good advice, and probably a core reason they (in particular) got mugged. Of course the mugger is the criminal and the sole cause (he was gonna mug someone regardless), but the victim can reduce their risk by avoiding X street.

&amp;gt;I can say "That's an unsafe neighborhood, we shouldn't carry expensive things around with us." That is an intelligent reasonable discussion on personal safety that does not include the victim in any regard. The two issues are separated and now the conversation is valuable.

I think this is what OP is trying to get at. Perhaps it's not the exact reason things happened, but it's a probable cause, and giving that advice to the victim might help them in the future.

But I agree, simply blaming the victim isn't helpful.</data>

And that also falls to victim blaming. Mary knows now that it is an unsafe area. Mary will instinctively avoid that area forever more. Telling her it's a bad place in no way improves that situation or helps. There is a strong lack of empathy for her by responding *to her* in such a manner.

However, if you say that exact same thing to your friend, neighbor, etc, that's helpful and fine. It brings awareness and other positive things. 

That's the difference. If you don't support the first statement, and you understand why you shouldn't say that *to* Mary, then you are not victim blaming.

It *sorta does*, depending on the amount of time and energy you spend on precautions. How much is the correct amount? Earlier in this comment, you advised Pat to avoid the park. Do you imagine this is a zero-cost precaution with respect to quality of life? Parks are pleasant places to be. Why would anyone *build* parks if there was no benefit to being in one?

&amp;gt; Maybe you really love taking risks - fine. That's your bad decision to make.

Excellent! We agree after all! Where's my delta? /s

&amp;gt; what's ethically wrong from trying to help people avoid victimhood?

See previous quoted block. At some point you should realize that the people who don't take your advice are not passing it up *because they didn't know*, but because they've *chosen* a riskier life for themselves. Statistically, I think you'll find the proportion of people who have genuinely never heard the most common "keep yourself safe" tips before, is approximately zero. [people with something *actually novel* to share, like some little-known pressure point or grappling technique, rarely elicit much hostility.]

If I want to take gratuitous risks (insofar as it's anyone's place but mine to determine what "gratuitous" means), as you generously gave me permission to do above, then how should I go about living my deliberately-chosen risky lifestyle *without* enduring a bunch of well-meaning harassment from people who can't fathom someone actually wanting to enjoy getting drunk with strangers, and who assume I just don't know what risk is?

If you see me jaywalking at a time and place where you would wait for a crosswalk light, is it reasonable to try and educate me about the fact that cars are dangerous? Or is it more reasonable to conclude that I am less risk-averse or in more of a hurry than you are?</data>

I have changed my view that it is a "worthwhile endeavor" (see other comment and edit for more detailed response). I still think "explaining causation" is not the same as "justifying an outcome", but I do think it's important to take into account the context / situation. As you say, there are certain cases in which explaining causation doesn't really do anything. In fact, as other users have pointed out, it can lead to increased guilt on the part of victims - particularly in sexual assault - even if that was not your intention.

EDIT: Also, your points about causation being a complex thing (which you make elsewhere as well) are good and I agree with them, but as others have said, I don't think they detract from the main point. The term "causation" was probably too ambiguous to have used, but I didn't want to go into statistical accounts of an outcome. The point remains that all of us take certain precautions to decrease the chance of certain outcomes. </data>

The blame for a crime *always* lies with the perpetrator of the crime. The mugger in this particular example is always at fault for the mugging.

That being said, people can reduce risk if they stay away from dangerous areas. Opting to avoid a safe route in favor of a dangerous one increases the risk of becoming a victim. People are responsible for risks that they assume. 

I realize that there is no "mugger's alley", and that it's entirely possible to get mugged anywhere. But aren't some areas shittier than others? If I waltz into the ghetto wearing a fancy clothes and a Rolex, did I not just make myself a target? If I get mugged,and  I decided to assume additional risk, am I not at responsible for assuming that risk? What about the consequences of the risk that I chose to assume? 

For example, I live near a shitty area. I also carry a concealed firearm and try to avoid the shittier parts of the area. Protecting yourself is your own responsibility.

Just because it's done by accident, doesn't mean she didn't in part cause the event to happen. You wouldn't die in a plane crash if you didn't fly in planes. So yes, it's partly your fault you died in a plane crash. Does that mean it's solely the victim's fault? No. But their assessment of risk was obviously wrong, and that's definitely their fault.

Walking around at night in an unfamiliar area? To me that screams 'danger!'. Getting lost? Bad planning. I always know where I'm going. Got in a fight? Don't cause fights and cause tension when driving around an unknown area.

All of those would be avoidable to the extent that you wouldn't be stranded in an unsafe, unfamiliar area.

&amp;gt;It's assumed that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response. 

Though it does. The problem is that Mary was mugged. The cause was that a mugger chose someone in an unsafe area (that street), and Mary happened to be there. Remove either Mary or the Mugger, and the problem is solved.

Had Mary been in her house, or in a public place or something, she wouldn't have been mugged. That is a fact.

Is it Mary's fault she got mugged? Partly. The crime itself was not caused by Mary. But she was in part the reason she was the victim.

&amp;gt;The world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. 

True. Which is why people adjust their behavior to *avoid* situations like the one Mary got into. Mary apparently lives in fantasy land where nothing bad happens, and thus doesn't account for it in her risk assessment.

&amp;gt; By saying things like "she shouldn't have been there" we are exactly saying "This would never happen to me because I would never do that"

But it's true. I've never been mugged. Ever. Though my house *has* been broken into, simply because I lived with my parents, and had a bad location (their choice). We then installed security systems. Not because we caused the crime. But because we reacted to it. Mary is the type of person who wouldn't install a security system. Simply because it's not her fault if her house is broken into.

&amp;gt;When we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don't talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don't talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was.

Your proposal is: "that street is dangerous". Which is *not* the problem and actually *avoids* the problem in general. The problem is that *one person* picked *mary* to mug. There's a few solutions. One is to get the mugger to stop mugging. Difficult. The alternative is to have mary avoid the mugger by avoiding places she knows he'll be. Easy.

Improving the safety of the street does absolutely nothing to solve the problem, seeing as the mugger will mug her on the next street over.

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt; Maybe this is just pedantic, because ultimately there is a correlation between entering that area and getting mugged. However, problems arise when people think they know how certain things correlate when they actually don't. Humans are actually quite bad at probabilities and intuitively understanding them. So it then becomes a problem when people think "i'm not blaming the victim, I'm recognizing a correlation," because they don't usually have a good reason to believe that they are really recognizing a correlation.

It's not just pedantic, it's completely incorrect. Walking into an area where mugging is common and subsequently being mugged is *absolutely not* an issue of misattributed correlation, it is a direct issue of causation. Don't enter the area, and you don't get mugged. It's certainly not the *only* cause at play (there's never just one cause, in that sense), but it certainly is causality and not just correlation.</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt;If I burn my hand, does telling me fire is hot help me?

Yup. Fire is hot, hot things burn your hand. You burned your hand, which means you touched a hot thing. That helps. Which is why we tell children that. Intuitively, you know touching *that thing in particular* hurts. But not why. The explanation then helps get a general understanding. Then we can say "X is hot" and you know not to touch it. You *can*, but you get that same hurt feeling as before, so you don't.

If we had not told you, you'd go and touch some other hot thing, and burn your hand again, being sure to avoid *that particular thing*. See the problem? Knowledge helps a lot.

Granted, I cant' be sure what you do/don't know. But I figure I should tell you either way to ensure you do know. Which is why I tell people things are hot, even after they burn themselves.

&amp;gt;If I stab myself with scissors, does telling me scissors are sharp help me? 

No, but your actions which lead you to stab yourself might help you learn why you got stabbed. If you were running, perhaps you didn't intuit that running makes it easier to get stabbed. Or perhaps I tell you a safer way to hold scissors (upside down, but the sharp part in your hand, with the handle up). That way of holding scissors reduces the problems while moving them around. Maybe you knew that. But I don't know if you do. I could also mention they are sharp, but you are old, so you should know that by now. And I'm guessing you don't get stabbed by scissors often because you take this information into account.

&amp;gt;My response to all of these things would be "No shit Sherlock".

A little kid might not know. Scissors are a simple example. Naturally people were told "these are sharp, don't run with them, hold upside-down, etc". Certainly little kids are told, both before and after. Why should other problems not be the same?

&amp;gt;My assumption here is that the victim we're discussing has at least an ounce of common sense. 

Perhaps they don't know that X street is dangerous and a common place  of muggings. They get mugged on X street. They might think it's simply the city, or perhaps they were targeted for some reason (wearing gang colors), or some other reason. Saying that it's X street, and lots of people get mugged there, is good information. It clues them in that it's a problem on X street, and not a problem with colors/clothing/city/time-of-day/etc.

X street during the day might be fine. And maybe at night too. Sometimes the problem is simply X street at 3 o'clock. Since that's when the trouble makers get off from school. So avoid X street at 3pm, and you are good to go.

That's *very* handy to have. Although it doesn't help the problem in general, it allows the victim to prevent further problems *to themselves*. Naturally the global solution would be to focus on the perpetrators, and get them to no longer cause problems. But in the short term (and locally), giving the victim this information can help prevent future problems.

Saying "it's your fault dumbass" doesn't help at all, and I'd agree. Sure, avoiding X street at 3pm might *seem* obvious, but perhaps you are new to town. Or maybe you just never visited X street before and don't know the advice to stay safe there.

&amp;gt;When something bad happens to a person, they know what happened.

Yes, they know "what happened" by they may not know all the causes. If you burn yourself "touching something hot" isn't the only cause. There's "something hot is around", "someone or something made something hot", "there's a specific place where hot things are", "hot things appear at this time and for this reason", and so on. You know to be careful around the stove, since there's hot things. But around the couch you are fine, since it's away from the danger of hot things.

You might not know that most hot things occur in the kitchen. Which would be good information. Naturally, this particular information is spread around as a kid, simply because of it's immediacy and how common it is.

A mugging is less common. So naturally less people might be aware of all the causes.

&amp;gt;Telling me to look out when I trip over a branch does me no good.

Sure it does. "Branches fall here all the time, so you have to watch your step". Helps in the future, when you walk through this area again, or in the immediate future so you don't immediately trip over another branch. It might've been a one time deal with that branch in the way, sure. But knowing whether branches fall there a lot is good information.

Just like how saying to "watch your step" on some stairs that have unequal stairs. You might fall, but not realize that's the reason you fell. So other people tell you to be careful on that staircase, because of the misaligned stairs. You might have attributed the cause to be simply your clumsiness, not realizing the stairs are actually at fault. Good information.

&amp;gt; Telling Bob tomorrow when you're walking down the street before he hits the branch does some good.

Right. But if Bob tripped yesterday, and I told him yesterday after he tripped. Today he'll be equipped to know to look out without needing to tell him again. If he trips again, perhaps bring it up one more time to ensure he knows.</data>

      <data key="d0">People have already covered the main relevant point, in that the term "natural" serves a useful purpose in denoting things that are not man-made, but I would like to point out that the opposite of "natural" for this usage isn't "unnatural"- it's "artificial." 

This might be the root of your intuition as to why you think man-made things are "natural." The term "unnatural" has a definition of "contrary to course of nature" or "abnormal." There is a value judgment here which says that non-human things are somehow pure, valuable, or simply otherwise separate from human affairs in a moral sense. When an environmentalist says that unnatural toxins are damaging the environment, what she means is not necessarily just that toxins are artificial, but that by producing them we are somehow upsetting the course of the universe. Similarly, when a fundamentalist says that homosexuality is "unnatural," he does not just mean that it is artificial in the sense of being created by society- he means that it is somehow wrong that this is a social artifact of humanity. 

I think what you mean to object to is "natural" in this sense of the word, which is perfectly reasonable. </data>

There are all kinds of nooks and crannies there. They may have not been possession of the faculties of a reasonable person (mentally challenged, mentally ill).

This shows that many people do not instinctively act to minimize their risks. In fact, anecdotally, we see this very often. We often see people (men and women) stay in an abusive relationship. These people intrinsically know that said relationship is unhealthy, they just don't leave it. I don't want to get into the causes of this, because there are many, but it is safe to cite this as an example of people going against their best interest. 

I agree that we need to stop blatant victim blaming. We shouldn't tell girls not to wear skirts because they're asking for it. That's wrong.

Know what isn't wrong though? Telling a girl she shouldn't get so drunk that she can't consent to sex. If you do that, you're putting yourself at risk. It's a stupid decision. Is it the girls fault that she got raped? No. But that doesn't mean that getting drunk off your ass is a good decision. 

We, as a society, don't feel bad for smokers who develop lung cancer. You participated in a high risk activity, and it back fired. We have no problem telling a smoker that they're putting themselves at risk for smoking, why do we have a problem telling a binge drinking frat girl that she's putting herself at risk to be raped. 

We need to get to a place in society where we can say "you did a stupid thing" without it meaning "you deserved to be sexually violated". We're at that place with smoking. Cancer survivors are told not to smoke anymore, and what other high risk activities they should limit. We aren't there yet with rape, and I would argue we are moving further and further from it.</data>

I don't live in these high-crime or dangerous areas, so it's easier for me to avoid them. If it means not walking by myself late at night, that doesn't impact my livelihood. So that's very relevant.

I am reconsidering the latter of my two points, which is that it's a worthwhile endeavor. Specifically: it's not always worthwhile to explain causation to someone, because many times they know already and cannot change the situation (maybe they work or live in an unsafe area, etc.). Do you think it's a worthwhile discussion to have in general, though? Like when people say things like "we need to have a societal conversational about X"? I just feel like the victim blaming issue is such a sensitive topic, it makes it difficult to have intelligent conversations about it without causing offense.

Cause I really don't. If there's proof I'm wrong, then I retract that statement, but I have a hard time buying it.

For a person with common sense, it wouldn't be an issue. But common sense isn't actually that common. A lot of people are pretty fucking dumb. My sister has had things stolen from her car multiple times because she can't be bothered to make sure it's locked. I personally knew a girl who was raped multiple times because she kept putting herself in the same situation: drinking excessively with sketchy people she barely knew, in locations where she didn't have transportation to leave. She certainly should have stopped putting herself in that situation (though that absolves the rapists of *none* of the blame for their actions), but she didn't; apparently, she needed to be told to do so.

&amp;gt;This falls under the assumption that Mary does know. If she does, then sure, she shares some responsibility. But we're assuming that she does know.

If Mary has been mugged in that area, then yes, she should know; if she *keeps* walking through that area despite her previous experience, well... perhaps she doesn't properly understand, and needs someone to explain it to her.</data>

      <data key="d0">Scenario 1:

Let's say you're a drug addict and due to your addiction you can't hold down a job, are really strung out and resort to one of the stupidest ways to make $100 for your next fix which is mugging people on the street. Not getting the money is not an option because you're desperate.

If one in 10,000 people are carrying firearms, do you take your chances and try to get someone to hand over their cash without shooting someone or do you kill them outright and steal their valuables off their corpse?

How does that decision change when the odds are 1 in 5?

Remember, you're an addict and not getting the money is not an option.


Scenario 2:

You're carrying and you rear end a guy. You pull over and the guy is really mad and he gets out of his car yelling up a storm. You know there is a 1 in 5 chance that the guy is carrying as well. When do you reach for your holster to draw your weapon and when do you fire it?

1. When he's angry and yelling at you?

2. When he reaches into his jacket where his holster might be?

3. After you see the gun?

4. After he points it at you?

5. After he starts shooting?

Scenario 3:

You're carrying and you just picked your brand new car up from the dealer and while you were at the stoplight some asshole that was obviously texting while driving rear ends you in your brand new car. You lose your temper and get out of your brand new car yelling up a storm. You notice after a bit of yelling that the guy is carrying and he has observed that you are as well and is scared.

Do you wait until you're sure he has decided to use his firearm to act? or do you act first because by the time you're sure he is going to draw his firearm, you won't have time to act before he shoots you?

The only reason this stuff doesn't happen all the time is because we can make the reasonable assumption that a person we are having a conflict with is unarmed. As soon as it becomes a reasonable assumption, immediately escalating a conflict to deadly force starts being the best option.

I've worked in customer service and have been yelled at by strangers more often than anyone should have. If I lived in a society where most people were carrying firearms, I would have had to ask myself "Is this person angry enough to kill me? because if I wait to find out for sure I'll already be dead" way more often than I'd like.</data>

Cause I really don't. If there's proof I'm wrong, then I retract that statement, but I have a hard time buying it.

Most crimes happen near the home. Most people have routine habits that damage themselves, their livelihood, their safety, etc. From a safety standpoint, there's absolutely no reason to go to a bar, which seems to be where a lot of crimes occur.

Naturally if you want to stay safe, avoid bars. A bunch of drunk people who can't reason through actions. Doesn't sound like the safest place in the world. Yet, most people routinely go to such a place.

There are people who intentionally live in sketchy and ghetto areas. There are people who travel through these areas daily.

So either they don't know, or they do and did proper risk assessment. If they didn't, you should inform them. If they did, it's their fault according to you.</data>

      <data key="d0">Think about a situation like the Aurora shooting.  A man walked into a crowded, public place, and begins shooting without warning.  Now imagine that a few people in the audience begin returning fire.  Do you think that all of them are going to correctly identify the original shooter in the confusion?  Do you think that all of the 20% of people with guns in the building will correctly guess that there is only one hostile target?  Now shots are coming from every direction, and the 80% of the crowd without guns have no idea which way they should be running to get to safety.  They are running in every direction, unpredictably entering the line of fire of the people with guns.  Now think about what happens when the police arrive and have no idea who they should consider a threat and who is a friendly, yet need to make that distinction immediately or risk being shot themselves.  

I think in many cases a confusing crossfire resulting in even more deaths is the only realistic outcome we can expect.  There will also be scenarios where all or most of the people in the area being attacked know each other well enough to recognize friend from foe, but in general these kinds of things happen in public places where people are strangers to one another.  In those situations the panic and confusion of adding more gunfire will usually make things worse.  Add in the fact that people are more likely to be killed by their own gun in either a home accident or a suicide than they are of using it to defend themselves and I don't see any reason to believe the proposed scenario would lead to a decrease in deaths.</data>

      <data key="d0">Depends on what goes down.  If there's some Jason Bourne type in the crowd who just pulls and puts the guy down right away I'd be thrilled.  But I think that it's more likely that someone who isn't prepared to deal with the stress and chaos of the situation will probably do more harm than good.  And the more people in the crowd all acting on their own, with no knowledge of which other shooters they should be shooting and and which ones they should be helping, the worse the situation is going to become.  

I think that scenario is more likely, especially if we start encouraging a social norm that as many people as possible should be prepared to open fire at a moments notice.  So I'll play the odds and say that we should avoid a culture with that expectation.  There may be a few shootings that go on longer than they would have in OPs proposed world, but overall there will be far fewer deaths if we don't go that way.</data>

&amp;gt;Also I'm not saying this would completely stop the threat of terrorists.

&amp;gt;These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government.

You can't stop terrorist attacks. They are a cowardly form of aggression. You can't take Karate classes to prevent from being blindly hit in the back of the head when walking down the street.

This is what has caused tribes, world powers and countries to invade others and root out there enemy rather than lie and wait to be attacked. 

I'm very pro-gun ownership. I find people who have 50 of them excessive. I think a shotgun in the home or a handgun in the car in a place accessible to you in the event of a break in or attack is a good protection. You wont miss an intruder in your home with a wide spread of a shotgun. Most intruders will turn and run at the sound of the shotgun cocking.

That is all you can protect personally with guns. 

Imagining yourself fending off a gunman in a crowded theater is ultimately a dream. If you carry a gun with an 8 to 9 round magazine you better be a damn good shot because crazed gunmen usually come with automatic weapons or weapons with extended magazines and it may not be there only weapon. 

If half the citizens carried in public places MP5's with 30 round clips you may be able stop a few random encounters over the years but then again you'd have citizens turning into militants.

This is in the context of a situation where someone is explaining a cause, and it is misconstrued as victim-blaming. While the proverbial butterfly flapping it's wings may be part of the chain, it's not something that is constructive to discuss. In much the same way, saying "you should stay in at night" or "you shouldn't dress like that" is equally not constructive.

These discussions about cause need to focus on what needs to be changed. The behavior of the perpetrator needs to be changed, not the behavior of the victim in most cases.</data>

My entire point is that this is a false dichotomy. The vast majority of things you do during your day are done *without* weighing up the pros and cons - spur-of-the-moment decisions, habit, gut instinct, tunnel vision, thoughtlessness, and so on. How could we possibly function day-to-day if we vacillated over the most minor and insignificant decisions? I have worn headphones and failed to be vigilant in dark and dangerous areas myself before, and probably far more often than I'm even aware of - not because I calculated the risk of being attacked and judged it to be a risk worth taking, but because the idea that I might be attacked didn't even enter my head. If someone had tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me, *hey, there's a real chance you might get violently attacked right now unless you pay more attention to your surroundings*, I probably would've heeded their warning.</data>

Harsher ~~laws~~ sentences for sexual abuse crimes?

I hate having the discussion at all because I always get stuck on this point. I know it's not the victim's fault. But like OP, I think discussing causation, even if it involves the victim, is important.

I have seen documented cases of women regretting sex they had while tipsy or drunk and then accusing the man of rape out of shame. 

I have also, obviously, seen many horrible documented cases, and rather high statistics, of actual rape. 

So it's a really shitty topic. A lot of it can't be "proven" in court, especially since, for example, in a lot of famous rape cases (Bill Cosby, Jian Ghomeshi recently), people are accusing each other YEARS or DECADES later. How the fuck are you gonna prove that without a rape kit, bruises, some kind of alibi or proof of where you were, any substantive evidence...</data>

      <data key="d0">OK, so, yes, in most cases, essential oils are bullshit when it comes to all this craze about natural healing products and whatnot. But there are some that are SO AWESOME!!! Props to you for being skeptical! Let me see if I can change your view on a couple of oils...

Lavender Oil: This is primarily used for relaxation and anxiety relief. There have been several studies performed over many years that have more or less proven this pretty well. I use it myself sometimes after laundering the bedclothes, putting a bit in the pillowcases. I used to foster a really crazy Yorkie, and a tiny dab of the oil on her paws made her unbelievably relaxed and calm.

Tea Tree Oil: This is good for minor infections and small wounds. It's endorsed by many doctors, and is even featured on WebMD for these uses (to a lesser extent a LOT of other healing things, but these haven't been studied well.) 

Peppermint Oil: While there aren't a lot of conclusive studies available for it, this shit is awesome for digestive issues in my experience when combined with other ingredients. The best medicine I ever had for digestive issues was infused with the stuff. Also, peppermint oil is AMAZING for deterring mosquitoes.

Anyway, the stuff is useful, and typically smells awesome. As long as she isn't destroying her own pocketbook, I think your wife will be fine. The three oils I mentioned (plus a few others) I buy myself at discounts, usually on Amazon, for the uses I mentioned. I don't know what kind of pyramid schemes you're referring to, but anything that is a pyramid scheme is probably bad. :(</data>

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt; People arise from nature. Humankind's capacity to create, problem-solve, analyze, rationalize, and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural?

While you are correct in this line of reasoning. Let me demonstrate how similar lines of reasoning could be used to render many words useless.

Humans are made up of billions of cells, the cells are made up of some number of atoms, and to go further down atoms are made up of quarks (to vastly simplify things a bit). So then why call anything "human"? We should really refer to each other as collections of subatomic particles since that is what we really are.

So what I'm getting at here is the idea that all words - every single one - were invented by humans to explain some kind of phenomena or object. If you exclusively use your definition for natural, then is anything unnatural?

Imagine you're an archaeologist and you're at a site. You pick up an arrowhead from 100 BCE and you declare, "I have found a natural rock!" That might confuse your colleagues, especially if some of them are geologists.

So we use the word "unnatural" to differentiate between things made by humans and not made by humans in some contexts. Basically, both you and your friend are correct and it all depends on the context you're using these words in.</data>

&amp;gt;What good does calling those people stupid do?

I also don't mean literally "you did a stupid thing" it was meant more as a placeholder.

&amp;gt;I have a problem with this because if you're in that situation, either one of two things has happened: you know you did a stupid thing or you didn't have the information at the time to make the correct choice.

I think it's safe to assume that everyone who is drinking is aware of the fact that drinking inhibits your ability to make good decisions. You would have a better argument regarding experience. "Campus rape is caused by excessive drinking by people who do not know how their body metabolizes alcohol or at what point they will become incapable of making sound decisions" is a better argument than just saying they didn't know they were putting themselves at risk.

&amp;gt;If people do know, give them a break. We're human. We fuck up. Rubbing it in does no good for anyone.

I would like to agree with you, but I just don't see it that way. We're at a place in society where people are upset that girls need to watch their drinks or not get black-out drunk. I don't agree with that. Everyone should watch their drinks. That's an important risk mitigating action you can take. People should not get black out drunk. I think we as a society should be allowed to tell people who have been abused as a result of these high risk actions that they're making bad decisions. We tell people who get lost in the forest that they should tell a friend when they go hiking next. We tell people who crash their cars because they were speeding that they should not speed. We tell victims of theft that they should make sure valuables aren't visible from outside. The only things we can't really do are tell female victims of assault or sexual assault that they should avoid the things that put them at high risk to be revictimized.

      <data key="d0">&amp;gt;This is where we disagree completely. You can't just dismiss these factors by saying it, theoretically or hypothetically could happen anywhere.

But you can, because as you said, it's a complicated issue. There are an endless number of factors and an endless number of crimes. No one is immune to either of these. Someone could be breaking in my house right now while I'm at work, despite my alarm and my locked doors. They could easily get some expensive things before the police arrive. Someone could be breaking into your house too. Someone could be planting a bomb in my building, or setting a fire upstairs. There's no reason why these things couldn't be happening to you, me, or anyone else. 

Is the likelihood higher or lower depending on factors? Yes. Are there things we can do to increase or decrease the likelihood? Yes. But no one is immune. There is nothing you can do to make yourself or anyone else immune. 

And if you think you are immune, please send me your magic immortality elixir. 

&amp;gt;and try to answer my question?

The question being: "Going from your example though, how could we talk about causation of, say, rape, regarding society as a whole?" based on my example of Mary? I feel like I've gone over this 100x times.

&amp;gt;The correct response is: "Well, that's unfortunate. That's a really unsafe area. The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area."

That's a very short summary of it. We talk about the situation. If muggings happen on First Avenue, let's talk about why and what we can do to protect ourselves. 

Why is First Avenue a dangerous location? Is it because of poverty? Education? Gangs? Drugs? What can we do to improve these factors to make it safer?

What can we do to protect ourselves? Should we not walk alone in these areas? Should we put up police boxes or security cameras? Should we hand out guns to every citizen? Should we increase police patrol in these areas? How do we balance budgets for the increased police force? What other areas of the budgets can we improve to allocate resources better to the community?

If say, Mary was murdered in a shooting. Are our gun laws strict enough? Was there something mentally wrong with this person and how do we improve mental care? Was this person not able to afford mental care, and if so how can we improve poverty or jobs or the healthcare system to improve these things?

If you want to make it smaller, you can focus it on small communities. Should we create a neighborhood watch? Should we put up more street lights? Should we gate our community? Should we have security cameras? Should we put up emergency boxes? Should we host self defense classes? 

These and more are all the conversations that should be started.

Similarly, certain forms of behaviour that may increase one's liklihood to be attacked (like paying for a drink in a sketchy bar by pulling out a thick money clip) will not necessarily lead to one becoming a victim. It isn't necessarily at all the case that somebody who did that and then got mugged upon exiting the bar would put the two together - informing them of how they increased their liklihood of being mugged could easily stop them from making that mistake again.</data>

Say the crime was some form of assault up to and including sexual assault. But we include details such as skimpy clothing (clothing that one puts on to look sexy), the area is a place that looks creepy but still has bars. Now imagine that the victim goes down an alley and that is where the assault happens.

Given this situation, we have personalities such as *thunderf00t* (on youtube) that will say this person should have known better then to go into such a high risk area, while not dismissing the crime itself. However, his approach has been called victim blaming and minimizing the crime.

Is there a responsibility on the part of the victim?

The view that says there is some responsibility on the part of the victim may include an analogy to wild animals with predator and prey. If a mouse walks out into the open and is nailed by a hawk — that mouse shouldn't have walked out into the open.

      <data key="d0">I actually think the discussion of autonomy and personal choice goes straight to the heart of OP's assertion of "worthwhile endeavour". The question of whether it's worthwhile to tell people stuff, depends on a couple of conditions:

1) whether or not they already knew the facts you're conveying  
2) whether or not the knowledge in question is of any value to them.

I've already gone over why it's condescending to make unfounded presumptions about 1), but this "autonomy" stuff all contributes to how we should evaluate 2). When someone interrupts your dinner to tell you about a phone company promotional offer, the aforementioned 2 assumptions are both at play: the advertiser is expressing an implicit assumption that you *didn't know* you could get unlimited domestic calling for only $8.95 a month,  which is probably a fair assumption if the promotion is new and insufficiently publicized, but also they're expressing an implicit assumption that *knowing about this deal would change your decision in any way,* and furthermore that *this knowledge(and the opportunity to act on it) is worth more to you than an uninterrupted dinner*.

This 2) thing, is an assumption about your priorities, about how much you value your time and money, and about what other long-distance options you have at your disposal. I daresay it's this second assumption which makes us mad at telemarketers, even when we legitimately didn't know about the deal being offered.

(How much worse would it be if the deal they were offering you, was just the exact same deal which you'd already been hearing about from every long-distance carrier for years? Most rape-safety advice-givers are not saying anything remotely new or unknown.)</data>

Yes, I will agree with you, if someone walks through a gunshooting range over and over and gets shot every single time, then I'm fine with directing the blame to them. And I'd probably direct them to a mental health professional. I feel this rarely if ever happens though. It's human nature to avoid situations after a trauma like a rape or mugging. People don't repeatedly make the same mistakes that lead to repeated harming of themselves. 

The OP suggests *he knows better* because he's been there and he's been mugged himself. That doesn't mean Mary knows that muggings have happened there, and unless you know the details of the situation (ie that Mary did know), it's unfair to immediately judge because it's making very large assumptions.  </data>

Should you tell Mary *before* that it's dangerous? YES, PLEASE DO.

Should you tell Mary after? Why? Do you think after she's been mugged/raped/whatever, she doesn't know? Do you believe the average person would repeat the action? Cause I really don't. If there's proof I'm wrong, then I retract that statement, but I have a hard time buying it.

This is a pretty vaguely-worded question in a number of ways. I'll focus on two:

Firstly, what does it mean *to Pat* to talk about whether or not Jamie's behaviour "can be changed"? From *Pat's* perspective, Pat has something to lose, and some hypothetical Jamie has something to gain. It's not in Jamie's interest to change behaviour, and it's not within Pat's capabilities to change Jamie's behaviour.

Secondly, if you're talking about optimisation, you shouldn't just be trying to optimise the expected outcomes. You should be trying to optimise *the trade-off between expected benefit and expected cost*. There are plenty of ways to get a good outcome (e.g. carry a gun and kill Jamie, or hire a permanent troop of bodyguards) that simply have prohibitively high costs. The costs of reforming Jamie are pretty high (Jamie would need to be arrested, spend time in prison / rehabilitation, etc. none of which Pat really has any control over) for pretty low expected payoff for Pat (what proportion of habitual violent criminals reoffend after prison?), whereas the cost for Pat to change behaviour are pretty low (take a different route, pay attention to surroundings) for an expected payoff that is very high to Pat (not becoming the victim of a violent crime). If Pat is thinking about optimisation, the choice is obvious.

&amp;gt; some compromise between freedom and safety

"Freedom" is a really strange term here. Does anyone really believe that they have the *freedom* to be safe?

&amp;gt; it's condescending ... to assume that the reason they don't [reduce the risks they face] is that they just didn't know they could.

No, but it's not condescending to assume the reason they don't is often because they simply don't consider it, or misjudge the danger. Many people subconsciously assume the chances that they will be attacked while alone in a park at night to be *so* low that they will fail to take even the most trivial, low-cost precautions such as being vigilant and not wearing headphones. This is a false assumption (proved time and time again by statistics like "1 out of every 4 women will get raped"). Saying "you should have been vigilant and not worn headphones!" is too little too late after an attack, but the speaker is undeniably *right* from the point of view of cost-benefit analysis.</data>

      <data key="d0">In principle, the line isn't that difficult to draw - the distinction is between causation and fault.

Victim-blaming is when you fault the victim for their misfortune: e.g. "Mary was reckless and is thus morally blameworthy for her attack."

It's not vicitm-blaming when you blamelessly attribute causation to behaviour: e.g. "Mary would not have been attacked but-for the route she took." That said, it's still insensitive: why are we talking about causation ex-post facto? What are we analyzing if not the attribution of blame? You'd better have a damned-good teaching moment planned otherwise you're just doing intellectual masturbation instead of sympathizing and it is *not appreciated*. 

Where it gets tricky is that causation and fault have lots of different standards, are easy to confuse, and if you're not careful it's very easy to  accidentally imply or have others infer fault, even when you only intend to speak to causation.

Standards of causation:

* Probabalistic: Mary increased the odds she would be attacked

* But-for: Mary would not have been attacked but-for her action (i.e. her action was necessary for the attack to have occured)

* [And many others](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality#Theories)

Standards of fault:

* Absolute liability: it's your fault because you were responsible for it not happening, and it happened anyway.

* Strict liability: it's your fault because you were responsible for it not happening, you did not do your due diligence to prevent it from happening, and it happened.

* Neglience: it's your fault because you had to take reasonable care of the situation, you failed to reasonably take care, and that failure caused it to happen.

* Recklessness: it's your fault because you wantonly disregarded the risks of it happening, and it happened.

* Intent: it's your fault because you tried to make it happen and it happened.

So if people are harsh in their standards of fault, any assertion of causation automatically becomes an assertion of fault (e.g. I think Mary is at-fault if she was negligent; you are saying that she didn't take reasonable care and that if she had she would have been safe; therefore you're asserting facts that would make her at-fault according to my fault standards, therefore you're blaming Mary).

So if you want to talk about causation without implying fault, you need to be explicitly generous in your fault standards: e.g. "Nobody is expected to act perfectly safely, taking risks is reasonable. It's not her fault. [Sensitive segue somehow]. Now here are the causal elements at play here."
